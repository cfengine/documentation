## Command or script execution ##

Execute a command, for instance to start a MySQL service. Note that simple shell commands like rm or mkdir cannot be managed by CFEngine, so none of the protections that CFEngine offers can be applied to the process. Moreover, this starts a new process, adding to the burden on the system.
