This example shows a simple ssh key distribution implementation.

The policy was designed to work with the `services_autorun` feature in
the [Masterfiles Policy Framework][Masterfiles Policy Framework]. The
`services_autorun` feature can be enabled from the augments_file. If
you do not have a `def.json` in the root of your masterfiles directory
simply create it with the following content.

```json {file="def.json"}
{
  "classes": {
               "services_autorun": [ "any" ]
             }
}
```

In the following example we will manage the `authorized_keys` file for
`bob`, `frank`, and `kelly`.

For each listed user the `ssh_key_distribution` bundle is activated if
the user exists on the system. Once activated the
`ssh_key_distribution` bundle ensures that proper permissions are set
on the users `.ssh` directory (home is assumed to be in
`/home/username`) and ensures that the users `.ssh/authorized_keys` is
a copy of the users `authorized_keys` file as found on the server as
defined in the `ssh_key_info` bundle.

Let's assume we collected all users' public keys into a single
directory on the server and that users exist on the clients (and have
corresponding home directory).

Note: special variable [`$(sys.policy_hub)`][sys.policy_hub] contains the hostname of
the policy server.

To deploy this policy simply place it in the `services/autorun`
directory of your masterfiles.

Example Run:

First make sure the users exist on your system.

```
root@host001:~# useradd bob
root@host001:~# useradd frank
root@host001:~# useradd kelly
```

Then update the policy and run it:

```command
cf-agent -Kf update.cf; cf-agent -KI
```
