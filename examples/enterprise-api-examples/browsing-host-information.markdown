A resource `/api/host` is added as an alternative interface for browsing host 
information. For full flexibility we recommend using [SQL][SQL Schema]
reports via `/api/query` for this. however, currently vital signs (data 
gathered from `cf-monitord`) is not part of the SQL reports data model.


## Example: Listing Hosts With A Given Context

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host?context-include=windows.*

**Response**

    {
      "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "count": 2,
        "total": 2,
        "timestamp": 1350997528
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "1c8fafe478e05eec60fe08d2934415c81a51d2075aac27c9936e19012d625cb8",
          "hostname": "windows2008-2.test.cfengine.com",
          "ip": "172.20.100.43"
        },
        {
          "id": "dddc95486d97e4308f164ddc1fdbbc133825f35254f9cfbd59393a671015ab99",
          "hostname": "windows2003-2.test.cfengine.com",
          "ip": "172.20.100.42"
        }
      ]
    }

## Example: Looking Up Hosts By Hostname

Contexts are powerful, as you can use them to categorize hosts according to a 
rich set of tags. For example, each host is automatically tagged with a 
canonicalized version of its hostname and IP-address. So we could lookup the 
host with hostname `windows2003-2.test.cfengine.com` as follows (lines split 
and indented for presentability).

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host?context-include=
       windows2003_2_stage_cfengine_com

**Response**

    {
      "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "count": 1,
        "total": 1,
        "timestamp": 1350997528
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "dddc95486d97e4308f164ddc1fdbbc133825f35254f9cfbd59393a671015ab99",
          "hostname": "windows2003-2.test.cfengine.com",
          "ip": "172.20.100.42"
        }
      ]
    }


#### Example: Looking Up Hosts By IP

Similarly we can lookup the host with hostname 
`windows2008-2.test.cfengine.com` by IP as follows (lines split and indented 
for presentability).

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host?
       context-include=172_20_100_43

**Response**

    {
      "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "count": 1,
        "total": 1,
        "timestamp": 1350997528
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "1c8fafe478e05eec60fe08d2934415c81a51d2075aac27c9936e19012d625cb8",
          "hostname": "windows2008-2.stage.cfengine.com",
          "ip": "172.20.100.43"
        }
      ]
    }


## Example: Removing Host Data

If a host has been decommissioned from a Hub, we can explicitly remove data 
associated with the host from the Hub, by issuing a DELETE request (lines 
split and indented for presentability).

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host/
       1c8fafe478e05eec60fe08d2934415c81a51d2075aac27c9936e19012d625cb8 -X DELETE

**Response**

    204 No Content

## Example: Listing Available Vital Signs For A Host

Each host record on the Hub has a set of vital signs collected by 
`cf-monitord` on the agent. We can view the list of vitals signs from as host 
as follows (lines split and indented for presentability).

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host/
       4e913e2f5ccf0c572b9573a83c4a992798cee170f5ee3019d489a201bc98a1a/vital

**Response**

    {
      "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "count": 4,
        "total": 4,
        "timestamp": 1351001799
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "messages",
          "description": "New log entries (messages)",
          "units": "entries",
          "timestamp": 1351001400
        },
        {
          "id": "mem_swap",
          "description": "Total swap size",
          "units": "megabytes",
          "timestamp": 1351001400
        },
        {
          "id": "mem_freeswap",
          "description": "Free swap size",
          "units": "megabytes",
          "timestamp": 1351001400
        },
        {
          "id": "mem_free",
          "description": "Free system memory",
          "units": "megabytes",
          "timestamp": 1351001400
        },
    }

## Example: Retrieving Vital Sign Data

Each vital sign has a collected time series of values for up to one week. Here 
we retrieve the time series for the `mem_free` vital sign at host 
`4e913e2f5ccf0c572b9573a83c4a992798cee170f5ee3019d489a201bc98a1a` for October 
23rd 2012 12:20pm to 12:45pm GMT (lines split and indented for 
presentability).

**Request**

    curl --user admin:admin http://test.cfengine.com/api/host/
