**Note:** This tutorial is for Enterprise users who have access to the Design Center, which
is located in the Mission Portal. CFEngine must be up and running in order to complete this 
tutorial. 

## Overview <a id="top"></a>
In this tutorial, we want to implement the following policy: The **iscsi-initatior-utils** software package 
should be present/installed on all hosts. Since CFEngine has a sketch that can generate this 
policy, we will use it to deploy our policy. (Note that you may use an alternate package from your 
system's package repository.)

A **sketch** defines configurable and reusable policy. You can use sketches to implement,
activate, or enforce policy. Sketches are written in the CFEngine 
policy language; you can use them simply by installing them, configuring them 
using the appropriate parameters and environments, and deploying them on your infrastructure. 

This tutorial provides instructions for the following:

* [Configure and deploy a policy using sketches in the Design Center](#conf)

* [Verify sketch deployment using Reports in the Mission Portal](#verify)

* [Create a query to narrow results using Report Builder in the Mission Portal](#query)


## Configure and deploy a policy using sketches in the Design Center <a id="conf"></a>
We will activate the **Packages** sketch which allows you to install selected software
packages on specific hosts. A sketch must include a **parameter set** and an **environment(s)**, both of which
we will set in the example below. Make certain that the packages you select are included in the 
package repository. (The package in our example below is available in the Centos package repository. You
can select any package that is available through your operating system's package repository.)

1. Log in to the Mission Portal. Select **Design Center** from the left sidebar.
2. Select the **Packages::installed** sketch. Use the following values:
   * **Descriptive name:** Enter **Install iSCSI**. This allows you to recognize the activation 
   (and its goal) later, as the Design Center uses this name when it commits changes to Git.
   * **Packages that should be installed:** Fill in the name of the package that must be installed.
   For this example, use **iscsi-initiator-utils**. This is the **parameter set**. 
   * **Hosts to activate on:** Click **Select category** to display host options. Select **All hosts**
   for our example. All host names appear. This is the **environment** in which the sketch
   must be activate.
   
   Here is an example:

3. Click **Activate**. This deploys the sketch to all hosts.
4. Enter a description in the **Commit your changes** window that appears. The Design Center
   uses this comment for version control when it commits changes to Git.
   Click **Commit** to complete the change.

**When a sketch is activated, the following occurs:**   

* The policy that is generated when the sketch is activated gets committed to your Git repository. 
This allows you to keep track of who has made what changes, and when, and why.
* The **policy server** is typically configured to check the Git repository every five minutes to ensure
that it is running the latest version of available policies. This process can be handled manually as well.
* The **hosts** check with the policy server for updated policy. They also work on default intervals of five minutes.
* The policy server collects information from the agents on the hosts to obtain insight 
   into the progress with executing the sketch. The information it collects is used to update 
   the information in the Design Center.
   
In total, this process might take a few minutes to converge to the correct state for all hosts. 
The process is very scalable, so even if it takes a few minutes for the two servers in this 
example to be updated, it does not take much longer to update 2,000 servers.
If you check back with the Packages sketch in the middle of the activation process, you will 
see a message that reads **Status: Being Activated**. Upon successful completion, the window 
should look like this:

Now that the sketch is deployed, CFEngine continuously verifies that it is maintained. It checks 
365 days per year, 24 hours per day, 12 times per hour to make certain this package is on all of the hosts. 
If the package is removed, it is added within five minutes, and CFEngine creates reports that it 
made a _repair_. Thus, the state of the overall system is known and stable and system drift is avoided. 
This works for 2, 20, 200, 2,000 or 20,000 servers.

## Verify sketch deployment using Reports in the Mission Portal <a id="verify"></a>
The Mission Portal contains standard Reports to facilite systems monitoring and management. We
will use the **Software installed** Report to verify that the Packages sketch we just activated
has been deployed.

1. Log in to the Mission Portal. Select **Reports** from the left sidebar.
2. Select the **Software installed** report from the list of reports that appear.
3. Scroll through the **Software installed** report to find the **iscsi-initiator-utils** software. To hasten your search,
   click the **SoftwareName** column in order to alphabetize the results. Another option is to 
   create a query in the Report Builder, which is described below.
4. The table shows that the **iscsi-initiator-utils** software is installed on both hosts:

## Create a query to narrow results using Report Builder in the Mission Portal <a id="query"></a>
Use the Report builder to create queries. In our example, we will create a query to verify that the
Packages sketch we just activated was deployed and that our software was installed.

1. Log in to the Mission Portal. Select **Reports** from the left sidebar.
2. Click **New report** to open the Report builder.
3. Under **Tables**, select **Hosts** and then **Software**. 
4. Enter the following **Field** values for the Hosts and Software tables:
  * For **Hosts** **Fields**, select **Host name**.
  * For **Software** **Fields**, select--and in the order shown--**Software name**,
   **Software version**, **Software architecture**. Note that the Mission Portal creates **Fields** in 
   the order that you select them.
5. Under **Filters**, click **Add**. Under **Software**, select **Software name**.
   For the **Software name** filter, select equals = and then enter **iscsi-initiator-utils**.
6. Click **Show Query** to view the SQL query that is generated from your selection.

Your completed query should look similar to this example:

![Report Builder](Report-builder.png)
   
   
Click **Run**. The Results reveal that the policy was generated when the sketch was deployed and activated on both hosts.
