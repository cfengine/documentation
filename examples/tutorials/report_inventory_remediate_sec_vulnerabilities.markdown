## Prerequisites

* CFEngine 3.6 Enterprise Hub
* At least one client vulnerable to CVE-2014-6271

## Overview

Remediating security vulnerabilities is a common issue. Sometimes you want to
know the extent to which your estate is affected by a threat.
Identification of affected systems can help you prioritize and plan remediation
efforts. In this tutorial you will learn how to inventory your estate and build
alerts to find hosts that are affected by the #shellshock exploit. After
identifying the affected hosts you will patch a subset of the hosts and then be
able to see the impact on your estate. The same methodology can be applied to
other issues.

**Note:** The included policy does not require CFEngine Enterprise. Only the
reporting functionality (Mission Portal) requires the Enterprise version.

## Inventory CVE-2013-6271

Writing inventory policy with CFEngine is just like any other CFEngine policy,
except for the addition of special `meta` attributes used to augment the
inventory interface. First you must know how to collect the information you
want. In this case we know that a vulnerable system will have the word
*vulnerable* listed in the output of the command
`env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' $(bash) -c 'echo testing CVE-2014-6271'`.

This bundle will check if the host is vulnerable to the CVE, define a class
*CVE_2014_6217* if it is vulnerable and augment Mission Portals Inventory
interface in CFEngine Enterprise.

```cf3 {file="inventory_CVE_2014_6271.cf"}
bundle agent inventory_CVE_2014_6271
{
  meta:
    "description" string => "Remote exploit vulnerability in bash http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271";
    "tags" slist => { "autorun" };

  vars:
    "env" string => "$(paths.env)";
    "bash" string => "/bin/bash";
    "echo" string => "$(paths.echo)";

    "test_result" string => execresult("$(env) x='() { :;}; $(echo) vulnerable' $(bash) -c 'echo testing CVE-2014-6271'", "useshell");

    CVE_2014_6271::
      "vulnerable"
        string => "CVE-2014-6271",
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=Vulnerable CVE(s)" };

  classes:
    "CVE_2014_6271"
      expression => regcmp( "vulnerable.*", "$(test_result)" ),
      scope => "namespace",
      persistence => "10",
      comment => "We persist the class for 2 agent runs so that bundles
		 activated before this bundle can use the class on the next
                 agent execution to coordinate things like package updates.";

  reports:
    DEBUG|DEBUG_cve_2014_6217::
      "Test Result: $(test_result)";

    CVE_2014_6271.(inform_mode|verbose_mode)::
      "Tested Vulnerable for CVE-2014-6271: $($(this.bundle)_meta.description)";
}
```

### What does this inventory policy do?

Meta type promises are used to attach additional information to bundles. We
have set 'description' so that future readers of the policy will know what the
policy is for and how to get more information on the vulnerability. For
the sake of simplicity in this example set 'autorun' as a tag to the bundle.
This makes the bundle available for automatic activation when using the autorun
feature in the Masterfiles Policy Framework.

Next we set the paths to the binaries that we will use to exeucte our test
command. As of this writing the paths for 'env' and 'echo' are both in the
standard libraries paths bundle, but 'bash' is not. Note that you may need to
adjust the path to bash for your platforms. Then we run our test command and
place the command output into the 'test_result' variable. Since we have no
*CVE_2014_6271* class defined yet, the next promise to set the variable
'vulnerable' to 'CVE-2014-6271' will be skipped on the first pass. Then the
classes type promise is evaluated and defines the class *CVE_2014_6271* if the
output matches the regular expression 'vulnerable.*'. Finally the reports are
evaluated before starting the second pass. If the class 'DEBUG' or
'DEBUG_inventory_CVE_2014_6271' is set the test command output will be shown,
and if the vulnerability is present agent is running in inform or verbose mode
message indicating the host is vulnerable along with the description will be
output.

On the second pass only that variable 'vulnerable' will be set with the value
'CVE-2014-6271' if the host is vulnerable. Note how this variable tagged with
'inventory' and 'attribute_name='. These are special meta tags that CFEngine
Enterprise uses in order to display information.

### Deploy the policy

As noted previously, in this example we will use autorun for simplicity. Please
ensure that the class "services_autorun" is defined. The easiest way to do this
is to change `"services_autorun" expression => "!any";` to `"services_autorun"
expression => "any";` in `def.cf`.

Once you have autorun enabled you need only save the policy into
`services/autorun/inventory_CVE_2014_6271.cf`.

### Report on affected system inventory

Within 20 minutes of deploying the policy you should be able to see results in the Inventory Reporting interface.

A new Inventory attribute 'Vulnerable CVE(s)' is available.

### Build Dashboard Widget with Alerts

Let's add alerts for CVE(s) to the dashboard.

## Remediate vulnerabilities

Now that we know the extent of exposure lets ensure bash gets updated on some
of the affected systems. Save the following policy into
`services/autorun/remediate_CVE_2014_6271.cf`

```cf3 {file="remediate_CVE_2014_6271.cf"}
bundle agent remediate_CVE_2014_6271
{
  meta:
    "tags" slist => { "autorun" };

  classes:
    "allow_update" or => { "hub", "host001" };

  methods:
    allow_update.CVE_2014_6271::
      "Upgrade_Bash"
        usebundle => package_latest("bash");
}
```

### What does this remediation policy do?

For simplicity of the example this policy defines the class allow_update on hub
and host001, but you could use any class that makes sense to you. If the
allow_update class is set, and the class *CVE_2014_6271* is defined (indicating
the host is vulnerable) then the policy ensures that bash is updated to the
latest version available.

### Report on affected systems inventory after remediation

Within 20 minutes or so of the policy being deployed you will be able to report on the state of remediation.

See the remediation efforts relfected in the dashboard.

## Summary

In this tutorial you have learned how to use the reporting and inventory
features of CFEngine Enterprise to discover and report on affected systems
before and after remediation efforts.
