Style is a very personal choice and the contents of this guide should only be
considered suggestions. We invite you to contribute to the growth of this
guide.

## Style summary

* one indent = 2 spaces
* avoid letting line length surpass 80 characters.
* vertically align opening and closing curly braces unless on same line
* promise type = 1 indent
* context class expression = 2 indents
* promiser = 3 indents, to allow for adding class guards without changing indent
* promise attributes = (we suggest 3 or 4 indents)

## Promise ordering

There are two common styles that are used when writing policy. The
[Normal Order][Normal ordering] style dictates that promises should be
written in in the Normal Order that the agent evaluates promises
in. The other is reader optimized where promises are written in the
order they make sense to the reader. Both styles have their merits,
but there seems to be a trend toward the reader optimized style.

1) Normal Order

Here is an example of a policy written in the Normal Order. Note how
`packages` are listed after `files`. This could confuse a novice who
thinks that it is necessary for the files promise to only be attempted
after the package promise is kept. However this style can be useful to
a policy expert who is familiar with Normal ordering.

```cf3
bundle agent main
{
  vars:

      "sshd_config"
        string => "/etc/ssh/sshd_config";

  files:

      "$(sshd_config)"
        edit_line => insert_lines("PermitRootLogin no"),
        classes => results("bundle", "sshd_config");

  packages:

      "ssh"
        policy => "present";
        package_module => apt_get;

  services:

    sshd_config_repaired::

        "ssh"
          service_policy => "restart",
          comment => "After the sshd config file has been repaired, the
                      service must be reloaded in order for the new
                      settings to take effect.";

}
```

2) Reader Optimized

Here is an example of a policy written to be optimized for the reader.
Note how packages are listed before files in the order which users
think about taking imperitive action. This style can make it
significantly easier for a novice to understand the desired state, but
it is important to remember that Normal ordering still applies and
that the promises will not be actuated in the order they are written.

```cf3
bundle agent main
{
  vars:

      "sshd_config"
        string => "/etc/ssh/sshd_config";

  packages:

      "ssh"
        policy => "present";
        package_module => apt_get;


  files:

      "$(sshd_config)"
        edit_line => insert_lines("PermitRootLogin no"),
        classes => results("bundle", "sshd_config");

  services:

    sshd_config_repaired::

        "ssh"
          service_policy => "restart",
          comment => "After the sshd config file has been repaired, the
                      service must be reloaded in order for the new
                      settings to take effect.";

}
```

## Whitespace and line length

Spaces are preferred to tab characters. Lines should not have trailing
whitespace. Generally line length should not surpass 80 characters.

## Curly brace alignment

Generally if opening and closing braces are not on a single line they should
be aligned vertically. Content inside braces can be indented one level over
instead of to the right of the braces.

Example:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  vars:
      "people" slist => {
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
          "Luke Skywalker",
          "Chewbacca",
          "Yoda",
          "Darth Vader",
      };

      "cuddly" slist => { "Chewbacca", "Yoda" };
}
```

## Promise types

Promise types should have 1 indent and each promise type after the first
listed should have a blank line before the next promise type.

This example illustrates the blank line before the "classes" type.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  vars:
      "policyhost" string => "MyPolicyServerHostname";

  classes:
      "EL5" or => { "centos_5", "redhat_5" };
      "EL6" or => { "centos_6", "redhat_6" };
}
```

## Context class expressions

Context class expressions should have 2 indents and each context class
expression after the first listed within a given promise type should have a
blank line preceding it.

This example illustrates the blank line before the second context class
expression (solaris) in the files type promise section:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:
    any::
      "/var/cfengine/inputs/"
        copy_from    => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/masterfiles","$(policyhost)" ),
        classes      => policy_updated( "policy_updated" ),
        depth_search => recurse("inf");

    solaris::
      "/var/cfengine/inputs"
        copy_from => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/masterfiles", "$(policyhost" ),
        classes   => policy_updated( "policy_updated" );
}
```

## Policy comments

In-line policy comments are useful for debugging and explaining why something
is done a specific way. We encourage you to document your policy thoroughly.

Comments about general body and bundle behavior and parameters should be
placed after the body or bundle definition, before the opening curly brace and
should not be indented. Comments about specific promise behavior should be
placed before the promise at the same indention level as the promiser or on
the same line after the attribute.

```cf3
bundle agent example(param1)
# This is an example bundle to illustrate comments
# param1 - string -
{
  vars:
      "copy_of_param1" string => "$(param1)";

      "jedi" slist => {
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
          "Luke Skywalker",
          "Yoda",
          "Darth Vader", # He used to be a Jedi, and since he
                         # tossed the emperor into the Death
                         # Star's reactor shaft we are including
                         # him.
      };
  classes:
      # Most of the time we don't need differentiation of redhat and centos
      "EL5" or => { "centos_5", "redhat_5" };
      "EL6" or => { "centos_6", "redhat_6" };
}
```

## Policy reports

It is common and useful to include reports in policy to get detailed
information about what is going on. During a normal agent run the goal is to
have 0 output so reports should always be guarded with a class. Carefully
consider when your policy should generate report output. For policy degbugging
type information (value of variables, classes that were set or not) the
following style is recommended:


```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  reports:
    DEBUG|DEBUG_example::
      "DEBUG $(this.bundle): Desired Report Output";
}
```

As of version 3.7 variables can be used in double colon class expressions. If
your policy will only be parsed by 3.7 or newer agents the following style is
recommended:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  reports:
    "DEBUG|DEBUG_$(this.bundle)"::
      "DEBUG $(this.bundle): Desired Report Output";
}
```

Following this style keeps policy debug reports from spamming logs. It avoids
polluting the `inform_mode` and `verbose_mode` output, and it allows you to get
debug output for ALL policy or just a select bundle which is incredibly useful
when debugging a large policy set.

## Promise handles

Promise handles uniquely identify a promise within a policy. We suggest a simple naming
scheme of `bundle_name_promise_type_class_restriction_promiser` to keep handles unique and
easily identifiable.  Often it may be easier to omit the handle.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  commands:
    dev::
      "/usr/bin/git"
        args    => "pull",
        contain => in_dir("/var/srv/myrepo"),
        if      => "redhat",
        handle  => "example_commands_dev_redhat_git_pull";
}
```

## Hashrockets (=>)

You may align hash rockets within a promise body scope and for grouped
single line promises.

Example:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:
    any::
      "/var/cfengine/inputs/"
        copy_from    => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/masterfiles","$(policyhost)" ),
        classes      => policy_updated( "policy_updated" ),
        depth_search => recurse("inf");

      "/var/cfengine/modules"
        copy_from => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/modules", "$(policyhost" ),
        classes   => policy_updated( "modules_updated" );

  classes:
      "EL5" or => { "centos_5", "redhat_5" };
      "EL6" or => { "centos_6", "redhat_6" };
}
```

You may also simply leave them as they are:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:
    any::
      "/var/cfengine/inputs/"
        copy_from => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/masterfiles","$(policyhost)" ),
        classes => policy_updated( "policy_updated" ),
        depth_search => recurse("inf");

      "/var/cfengine/modules"
        copy_from => update_policy( "/var/cfengine/modules", "$(policyhost" ),
        classes => policy_updated( "modules_updated" );

  classes:
      "EL5" or => { "centos_5", "redhat_5" };
      "EL6" or => { "centos_6", "redhat_6" };
}
```

Which one do you prefer?

## Naming conventions

Naming conventions can also help to provide clarity.

### Snakecase

Words delimited by an underscore. This style is prevalant for *variables*,
*classes*, *bundle* and *body* names in the Masterfiles Policy Framework.


[%CFEngine_include_example(style_snake_case.cf)%]

### Pascalecase

Words delimited by capital Letters.

[%CFEngine_include_example(style_PascaleCase.cf)%]

### Camelcase

Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.

[%CFEngine_include_example(style_camelCase.cf)%]

### Hungarian notation

[Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) can
help improve the readability of policy, especially when working with lists and
data containers where the use of `@` or `$` significantly affects the behavior
of the policy.


[%CFEngine_include_example(style_hungarian.cf)%]

## Classes

Classes are intended to describe an aspect of the system, and they are
combined in expressions to restrict when and where a promise should be
actuated. To make this desired state easier to read classes should be
named to describe the current state, not an action that should take
place.

For example, here is a policy that uses a class that indicates an
action that should be taken after having repaired the sshd config.

```cf3
bundle agent main
{
  vars:
      "sshd_config" string => "/etc/ssh/sshd_config";

  files:
      "$(sshd_config)"
        edit_line => insert_lines("PermitRootLogin no"),
        classes => if_repaired("restart_sshd");

  services:

    !windows::

      "ssh"
        service_policy => "start",
        comment => "We always want ssh to be running so that we have
                    administrative access";

    restart_sshd::

      "ssh"
        service_policy => "restart",
        comment => "Here it's kind of hard to tell *why* we are
                    restarting sshd";
}
```

Here is a slightly improved version that shows using classes to describe the
current state, or what happened as the result of the promise. Note how it's
easier to determine **why** the ssh service should be restarted. Using
the [`results`][lib/common.cf#results], `scoped_classes_generic`, or
`classes_generic` classes bodies can help improve class name consistency and are
highly recommended.

```cf3
bundle agent main
{
  vars:
      "sshd_config" string => "/etc/ssh/sshd_config";

  files:
      "$(sshd_config)"
        edit_line => insert_lines("PermitRootLogin no"),
        classes => results("bundle", "sshd_config");

  services:

    !windows::

      "ssh"
        service_policy => "start",
        comment => "We always want ssh to be running so that we have
                    administrative access";

    sshd_config_repaired::

      "ssh"
        service_policy => "restart",
        comment => "After the sshd config file has been repaired, the
                    service must be reloaded in order for the new
                    settings to take effect.";
}
```

## Deprecating bundles
As your policy library changes over time you may want to deprecate various
bundles in favor of newer implimentations. To indicate that a bundle is
deprecated we recommend the following style.

```cf3
bundle agent old
{
  meta:
    "tags" slist => {
      "deprecated=3.6.0",
      "deprecation-reason=More feature rich implimentation",
      "replaced-by=newbundle",
    };
}
```
## Tooling

Currently, there is no canonical policy linting or reformatting tool. There are a few different tools that can be useful apart from an [editor with syntax support][Editors] for achieving regular formatting.

### cf-promises

`cf-promises` can output the parsed policy using the ```--policy-output-format``` option. Beware, this will strip macros as they are done during parse time.

Example policy:

```cf3
bundle agent satellite_bootstrap_main
{

@if feature(this_is_not_the_feature_your_looking_for)
   Hello there.
@endif

  meta:

    (!ubuntu&!vvlan&!role_satellite)::
      "tags" slist => { "autorun" };

  methods:

      "bootstrap rhel7 servers to satellite every 24 hours"
        usebundle => satellite_bootstrap,
        action => if_elapsed(1440);

}
```

Output the parsed policy in ```cf``` format:

```console
cf-promises -f /tmp/example.cf --policy-output-format cf
```

Formatted parsed policy:

```cf3
bundle agent satellite_bootstrap_main()
{
meta:
  (!ubuntu&!vvlan&!sarcrole_satellite)::
    "tags"        slist =>  {"autorun"};

methods:
  any::
    "bootstrap rhel7 servers to satellite every 24 hours"        usebundle => satellite_bootstrap,
        action => if_elapsed("1440");


}

body file control()
{
  inputs =>  {"$(sys.libdir)/stdlib.cf"};

}
```

### CFEngine beautifier

Written as a package for the Sublime Text editor, the [CFEngine Beautifier](https://github.com/naksu/cfengine_beautifier) can also be used from the command line as a stand-alone tool.

### reindent.pl

[`reindent.pl`](https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/master/contrib/reindent.pl)
is available from the contrib directory in the core repository. You can run
`reindent.pl FILE1.cf FILE2.c FILE3.h` to reindent files, if you don't want to
set up Emacs. It will rewrite them with the new indentation, using Emacs in
batch mode.
