# CFEngine Documentation

This repository hold the content for the technical CFEngine documentation in
markdown files. If you have a texteditor, know how to write markdown and
English and would like to contribute to the CFEngine documentation, then we'd
like to invite you to collaborate here!

If you would like to notify us about incorrect documentation, but don't have
the time or the knowledge to make a correction directly here, then you can
report the issue in the regular [CFEngine bug
tracker](https://cfengine.com/dev/projects/core).  Use the "Documentation"
category when you create bugs. And of course you can search the bug tracker
for known issues with the documentation, and maybe help the community of
CFEngine users by correcting some of those here!

## Writing Documentation

The CFEngine documentation is written in regular
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

To keep the source readable in git and workable with a broad range of tools,
keep the line length in paragraphs below 78 characters.

If you don't know git, then you can still contribute to the documentation
using the GitHub interface as long as you have a GitHub account. Fork this
repository (called the *upstream*) using the GitHub web interface, make
changes in your fork and create pull requests so that your changes can be
merged into the *upstream* repository.

It is in general advisable to make small commit that are submitted through
pull requests frequently. Otherwise any structural changes to documentation
content can cause merge conflicts that are hard to resolve.

## Documentation Structure

### Structure

Pages are organized hierarchically in category/subcategory relationships.
Those are defined by the `categories` META data (in YAML) in the markdown
file:

    categories: [Path, Of, Categories, Page]

This creates the navigation structure on the left hand side of the published
documentation. The HTML files are all created into the same directory, so the
alias META has to specify a unique filename.

    alias: path-of-categories-page.html

To make it easier to locate files in the repository, the markdown sources are
organized in a directory structure that corresponds with the categorization,
for example:

    documentation/path/of/categories/page.markdown

Filenames are lower-case. Markdown-files in each subdirectory can be created
as well with content providing an overview for that category.

### META tags

Additional META tags you should set are:

    layout: default

Leave this as default.

    title: "The Title"

The title of the page. Quoting is only necessary if the title contains YAML
keywords (like "on").

    published: true|false

Pages that set this tag to `false` will not be published.

    tags: [list, of, tags with space, all lowercase]

Keywords for this page, which will be displayed on top of the page, and used
when generating the tag-pages.

    reviewed: yyyy-mm-dd
    reviewed-by: github-user

Keeping track of when a documentation page has last been reviewed.

META tag values will be interpreted literally, and cannot contain `:`, `[` and
`]`.

### Image files

Image files are in the same directory as the markdown files that embed them.
Give files unique names to avoid overwrites in the generated website.

See [Style Guide - Charts and graphs](#Charts_and_graphs) for style
requirements for images.

## Content Style Guide

Make sure you follow this style guide to make using CFEngine and the
documentation a consistent and pleasant experience.

### Writing for the web

* use subheadings to structure content
* keep paragraphs short
* support scanning of pages

### Spelling

CFEngine documentation follows the American spelling.

### Punctuation

**Oxford comma**

In punctuation, a serial comma (also called Oxford comma) needs to be placed
immediately before the conjunction (often “and” or “or”) in a series of three
or more terms.

*Example:*

I would like crackers, cheese, and garlic.

**The comma as a separator between compound sentences**

Use commata to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of
these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet.

However, the comma can be dropped in the following cases:

* if both independent clauses are quite short, especially if the two clauses
  are very closely related, and even more so if the subject of both clauses is
  the same, or
* if only the first clause is quite short, especially if the two clauses are
  very closely related, and even more so if the subject of both clauses is the
  same.

**Periods and spaces**

The period ending a sentence should be followed by 1 space.

### Abbreviations

As a general note, avoiding abbreviations provides better readability.

**Latin expressions commonly used in English**

* i.e. (that is)
* e.g. (for example)
* cf. (compare)
* etc. (and so forth)
* vs.(versus)
* et al. (and others)

### Charts and graphs

* use clear shapes
* avoid shadows
* stick to black, white, and grey
* avoid background fill colors on large items

## Technical reference documentation

* follow the [Policy Style Guide](manuals/policy-style.markdown)
  in examples and code snippets
* always run it through Pygments plus the appropriate lexer (only cf3
  supported for now)
* avoid custom color schemes and hand-coded HTML
* document the example after the example code

The structure of the technical documentation about CFEngine attributes, 
functions etc is as follows:

### Functions

No header necessary - there is one function per page, and the page's
title is the name of the function.

    **Prototype:** `function(named, parameters)`
    
    **Return type:** `datatype`

    **Description:** Returns something based on `named` and `parameters`.

    The first line of the  description is a single line of text, summarizing
    what the function does and references the most important parameters by
    name.

    Longer explanation on what it does and why it is useful then afterwards.

    Over multiple paragraphs if necessary.

    **Arguments:**
    
    * `named`: valid input
    
    First argument does this.
    
    * `parameters`: valid input
    
    This argument does that.

    **Example:**

    ```cf3
        Some code with 
        cf3 markers
        for syntax highlighting
    ```

    If the example requires explanation, do it here. Consider using
    CFEngine comments within the code directly to explain.

    **Notes:**
    
    Additional information, spanning as many paragraphs as necessary, but mind
    the style guide.

### Promise Attributes

Promise attributes are documented within the respective promise types's reference
page. Level-3 headers are used to start a new attribute:

    ### Promise Attribute

    **Description:** One line summary.

    Longer explanation on what it does and why it is useful,
    over multiple paragraphs if necessary.

    Specifics about "input range" in the notes.

    **Type:** `datatype`, (menu option) or `body promise_attribute`

If the promise attribute has a body type, then skip the rest, and see next section.

    **Allowed input range:** `value range` or
    ```cf3
        List
        of
        menu
        options
    ```
    In case of menu option types, make sure you explain what each value does.

    **Default value:** `value` (if applicable)

    **Example:**

    ```f3
        Some code with 
        cf3 markers
        for syntax highlighting
    ```

    If the example requires explanation, do it here. Consider using
    CFEngine comments within the code directly to explain.

    **Notes:**
    
    Additional information, spanning as many paragraphs as necessary, but mind
    the style guide.

### Bodies

For promise attributes with a body type, you can start with an example of that
body type, with the most relevant attributes set to self-explanatory values.

    ```cf3
    body promise_attribute example
    {
       attribute1 => "value1";
       attribute2 => "value2";
    }
    ```

Start explaining each attribute in the body then using level4-headings:

    #### attribute1
    
    **Description**:
    
    **Type**: `datatype`
    
    **Allowed input range**:
    
    **Default value**:
    
    **Example**:
    
    **Notes**:

The sections follow the style for promise attributes, see above. Examples
should be a code snippet at this point, no need for a complete piece of
runnable code.

### Special Variables

Special Variables are documented within the page of their context.

    ### context.variable
    
    Explanation.

## Publishing

Jekyll is used to generate the HTML pages. The toolchain is available at
https://github.com/cfengine/documentation-generator After you compile pages,
Jekyll will place all files into the _site folder, without subdirectories.

Commits in this repository trigger the documentation generator to run, which
then updates the contents of http://cfengine.com/tmp_docs/
