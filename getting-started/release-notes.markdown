**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *This is a pre-release of 3.5, intended for testing and showcase only.
This version is not supported, not covered by service level agreements (SLAs) and not
intended for production environments. Do not upgrade or use in conjunction with other
versions at this point. We are planning monthly snapshot (alpha) releases going forward,
but official release date for 3.5 has not been set.*

<!--- TODO: move up when no longer a pre-release

## Easier to Use

No matter if you are just starting with configuration management and system automation,
if you are a CFEngine novice or a battle-hardened policy coder, the new features
in CFEngine 3.5 will make it easy for you to get stuff done.

### Design Center, with UI in CFEngine Enterprise

**TODO:** screenshot, video, messaging?

CFEngine Enterprise 3.5 includes the brand-new **Design Center app** in the 
Mission Portal. You are now able to conveniently configure and activate
sketches through an easy to use graphical interface, and to follow up on
the activation progress.

### Significantly improved parsing and evaluation of policies

A large number of parser and evaluation problems have been fixed. Iterating 
over **arrays with nested lists** has caused many headaches and workarounds in 
previous versions of CFEngine. With 3.5, many of those can disappear.

Policy developers get **clear and consistent messages** from the parser.
`cf-promises` allowing partial check of policy - now you are not required
to have `body common control` to check syntax. This will allow better
integration with editors to perform automatic syntax validation.

`action_policy => warn` now sets `not_kept` classes, which allows you to see deeper than first order changes that might occur during **dry-runs**.

The **new `scope` attribute** in `classes` bodies allows policy writers to set 
non global classes based on result of a promise. This reduces managing class 
naming conflicts, especially when multiple activations of a bundle may happen. 

Significant enhancements to bundle common paths, including the ability to
test with automatically defined classes. Policy writers don't have to maintain 
their own common paths locations, or hard code paths into each bundle for 
paths that are well known.

CFEngine operators benefit from a range of improvements in **logging output**, 
both to the syslog and to the standard output.

**TODO:** screenshot, example, ???

### New built-in functions and capabilities

A broad range of new built-in functions simplify the coding of policies
significantly and offer completely new functionality.

* set operation functions that test for set membership and find
    intersections/differences:
    * [`every`](reference-functions-every.html)
    * [`none`](reference-functions-none.html)
    * [`some`](reference-functions-some.html)
    * [`intersection`](reference-functions-intersection.html),
    * [`difference`](reference-functions-difference.html)
* list functions  to look up a specific element, find the list length, extract a
  portion of the list, reduce it to unique element, sort it, and filter it
    * [`nth`](reference-functions-nth.html)
    * [`length`](reference-functions-length.html)
    * [`sublist`](reference-functions-sublist.html)
    * [`unique`](reference-functions-unique.html)
    * [`sort`](reference-functions-sort.html)
    * [`shuffle`](reference-functions-shuffle.html)
    * [`filter`](reference-functions-filter.html)
* function that returns an slist of all the classes that match a regular
  expression
    * [`classesmatching`](reference-functions-classesmatching.html)
* function that prints the time now or at a particular point
    * [`strftime`](reference-functions-strftime.html)
* function for building strings using sprintf semantics
    * [`format`](reference-functions-format.html)
* function for making logical decisions in a function call based on classes
    * [`ifelse`](reference-functions-ifelse.html)
* mapping function for arrays
    * [`maparray`](reference-functions-maparray.html)
* function for getting detailed file information
    * [`filestat`](reference-functions-filestat.html)

**TODO:** screenshot or code snippet?

### Improved out-of-the-box installation

In CFEngine Enterprise, the CFEngine Server and the Mission Portal UI are all 
up and running as soon as the package installation is completed.

**New bootstrap semantics** makes bootstrapping simpler. **avahi auto
discovery** is available now in addition to specifying a static ip. Clearer
messages during the bootstrapping process makes it easier to analyze why
things might not have worked.

## Report collection at arbitrary scale

### Infinite scalability across multiple sites

* support for [Multi-Site
  Querying](manuals-enterprise-api-multi-site-queries.html)
* improved performance of `cf-serverd`, handling more connections in parallel

**TODO:** Link to demo video

### Improved SQL reporting

* Promise logs, file, software and compliance information are available
  through SQL Report app

All **CFEngine reports** are now based on **SQL syntax**. Run one of our
ready-madereports with a single click, or define your own using the graphical 
query  builder or direct SQL input. Save and schedule your reports in a quick 
and easy way.

* Regular expressions are supported in SQL queries
* [Enterprise API](manuals-enterprise-api.html)** supports host
  and promise filtering

## Better tools for CFEngine operators

* Self-diagnostics of agent binaries **TODO:**link to --self-diagnosics
* Collect data for hub diagnostics
    * performance data from MongoDB
    * Include lastseen report data
    * FirstReportTimeStamp is recorded for all hosts
    * diagnostic data from cf-hub
    * data is available through SQL queries
* Configurable data collection for Enterprise
    * Host-side report content filter, controlled by `report_data_select` body
   in [access promise](reference-promise-types-access.html)
    * filters for class, variable, promise log and monitoring reports

## Streamlined Mission Portal

**TODO:** screenshot

The Mission Portal has received another **major facelift** for this release. 
Plenty of polish went into the visual and interaction design.

**Host categorizations** (aka navigation trees) has received a performance 
boost, and can now be shared between users. Partition your system any way you 
like, save your categorization, and give others access. Or simply add othersâ€™ 
categorizations to your own account.

## Microsoft Windows specific improvements

* Windows PowerShell support in [commands
  promises](reference-promise-types-commands.html),
  [`execresult`](reference-functions-execresult.html) and 
  [`returnszero`](reference-functions-returnszero.html)
* Improved ACL handling on Windows
   * Note the syntax changes in the **TODO**[ChangeLog]
