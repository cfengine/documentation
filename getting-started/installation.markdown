**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *This is a pre-release of CFEngine, intended for testing
and showcase only. This version is not supported, not covered by service level
agreements (SLAs) and not intended for production environments. Do not upgrade
or use in conjunction with other versions at this point.

<!--- TODO: move up when no longer a pre-release
-->

## General Requirements

CFEngine recommends the following:

**Host(s) Memory** 

256 MB available memory in order to run the CFEngine agent software (cf-agent).

**Disk Storage** 

A full installation of CFEngine requires 25 MB. Additional disk usage 
depends on your specific policies, especially those that concern reporting.

**Network** 

* Verify that the machineâ€™s network connection is working and that port 5308
  (used by CFEngine) is open for both incoming and outgoing connections.

* If iptables are active on your operating system, stop this service or adapt
  it to allow for communication on the above ports. If applicable, type the
  following two commands: /`etc/init.d/iptables stop` and `chkconfig iptables
  off`

CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies into the package; therefore,
additional software is not required.
