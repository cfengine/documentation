**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *This is a pre-release of CFEngine, intended for testing
and showcase only. This version is not supported, not covered by service-level
agreements (SLAs), and not intended for production environments. Do not

CFEngine comes in two versions:

a licensed edition for enterprises that plan to use the tool in production environments. The Enterprise edition can be evaluated for free (up to 25 servers).
