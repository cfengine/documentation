## General Requirements

CFEngine recommends the following:

**Host(s) Memory** 

256 MB available memory in order to run the CFEngine agent software (cf-agent).

**Disk Storage** 

<<<<<<< HEAD
A full installation of CFEngine requires 25 MB. Additional disk usage
depends on your specific policies, especially those that concern reporting.
=======
Install and test the latest [version of Community][Installing Community]. In addition to 
instructions, the section also includes simple tutorials to get you started, followed by more 
advanced tutorials to help your learn the CFEngine language and functionality.

**Network** 

* Verify that the machineâ€™s network connection is working and that port 5308
  (used by CFEngine) is open for both incoming and outgoing connections.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* If iptables are active on your operating system, stop this service or adapt
  it to allow for communication on the above ports. If applicable, type the
  following two commands: /`etc/init.d/iptables stop` and `chkconfig iptables
  off`

CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies into the package; therefore,
additional software is not required.
=======
All installations feature instructions and tutorials. One tutorial teaches you how to use the 
Mission Portal console; the others help your learn the CFEngine language and functionality. 

Just the installation that best suits your needs.
