### Reports in outputs

The outputs directory contains a time-stamped list of outputs generated
by `cf-agent`. These are collected by `cf-execd` and are often emailed
as reports. However, not all hosts have an email capability or are
online, so the reports are kept here. Reports are not tidied
automatically, so you should delete these files after a time to avoid a
build up.
