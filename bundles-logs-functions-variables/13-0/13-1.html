<h3>13.1 Embedded Databases</h3>

<p>The embedded databases can be viewed and printed using the reporting tool <code>cf-report</code>.

   <p>Their file extensions will vary based on which library is used to implement them; either Tokyo Cabinet (<code>.tcdb</code>), Quick Database Manager (<code>.qdbm</code>), or Berkeley DB (<code>.db</code>). Converting one database format to another is not handled by CFEngine, but there exist external tools meant for that purpose.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span>cf_Audit.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A compressed database of auditing information. This file grows very large
is auditing is switched on. By default, only minor information about CFEngine runs are recorded. This file should be archived and deleted regularly to avoid choking the system. 
<br><dt><samp><span>cf_lastseen.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of hosts that last contacted this host, or were contacted by this host, and includes the times at which they were last observed. 
<br><dt><samp><span>cf_classes.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of classes that have been defined on the current host, including their relative frequencies, scaled like a probability.

     <br><dt><samp><span>checksum_digests.tcdb</span></samp><dd>The database of hash values used in CFEngine's change management functions. 
<br><dt><samp><span>performance.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of last, average and deviation times of jobs recorded by <code>cf-agent</code>. Most promises take an immeasurably short time to check, but longer tasks such as command execution and file copying are measured by default. Other checks can be instrumented by setting a <code>measurement_class</code> in the <code>action</code> body of a promise.

     <br><dt><samp><span>stats.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of external file attributes for change management functionality.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/cf_lock.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of active and inactive locks and their expiry times. Deleting this database will reset all lock protections in CFEngine.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/history.tcdb</span></samp><dd>Enterprise level versions of CFEngine maintain this long-term trend database.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/cf_observations.tcdb</span></samp><dd>This database contains the current state of the observational history of the host as recorded by <code>cf-monitord</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/promise_compliance.tcdb</span></samp><dd>Enterprise CFEngine (Nova and above) database of individual promise compliance history. The database is approximate because promise references can change as policy is edited. It quickly approaches accuracy as a policy goes unchanged for more than a day.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/cf_state.tcdb</span></samp><dd>A database of persistent classes active on this current host.

     <br><dt><samp><span>state/nova_measures.tcdb</span></samp><dd>Enterprise CFEngine (Nova and above) database of custom measurables. 
<br><dt><samp><span>state/nova_static.tcdb</span></samp><dd>Enterprise CFEngine (Nova and above) database of static system discovery data.
