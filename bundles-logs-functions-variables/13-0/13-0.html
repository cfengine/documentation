<h2>13 Logs and records</h2>

<p><br>

   <p>CFEngine writes numerous logs and records to its private workspace, referred to as <samp><span>WORKDIR</span></samp>. This chapter makes some brief notes about these files. CFEngine approaches monitoring and reporting from the viewpoint of scalability so there is no default centralization of reporting information, as this is untenable for more than a few hundred hosts. Instead, in the classic CFEngine way, every host is responsible for its own data. Solutions for centralization and netwide reporting will be given elsewhere.

   <p>The filenames referred to in this section are all relative to the CFEngine work directory <samp><span>WORKDIR</span></samp>.
