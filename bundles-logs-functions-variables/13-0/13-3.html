<h3>13.3 Reports in outputs</h3>

<p>The <samp><span>outputs</span></samp> directory contains a time-stamped list of outputs generated by <code>cf-agent</code>. These are collected by <code>cf-execd</code> and are often emailed as reports. However, not all hosts have an email capability or are online, so the reports are kept here. Reports are not tidied automatically, so you should delete these files after a time to avoid a build up.
