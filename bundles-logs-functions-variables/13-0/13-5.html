<h3>13.5 State information</h3>

<p>The CFEngine components keep their current process identifier number in `pid files' in the work directory. For example:

<pre>cf-execd.pid
cf-serverd.pid
</pre>

   <p>Most other state data refer to the running condition of the host and are generated by <code>cf-monitord</code> (<code>cfenvd</code> in earlier versions of CFEngine).

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span>state/env_data</span></samp><dd>This file contains a list of currently discovered classes and variable values that characterize the anomaly alert environment. They are altered by the monitor daemon. 
<br><dt><samp><span>state/all_classes</span></samp><dd>A list of all the classes that were defined the last time that CFEngine was run. 
<br><dt><samp><span>state/cf_*</span></samp><dd>All files that begin with this prefix refer to cached data that were observed by the monitor daemon, and may be used by <code>cf-agent</code> in <code>reports</code> with <code>showstate</code>.
