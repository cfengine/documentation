9 Bundles of `knowledge`

         bundle knowledge system

         topics:

           "Segmentation fault"
                association = a("is caused by","Bad memory reference","can cause");
         
           "Remote connection problem";
           "Web server not running";
           "Print server not running";
           "Bad memory reference";
         }

Knowledge bundles describe topic maps, i.e. Topics, Associations and
Occurrences (of topics in documents). This is for knowledge modeling and
has no functional effect on a system.
