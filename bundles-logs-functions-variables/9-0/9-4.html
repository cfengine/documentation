<h3>9.4 <code>occurrences</code> promises in <samp><span>knowledge</span></samp></h3>

<p><br>

   <p>Occurrences are documents or information resources that discuss topics. An occurrence promise asserts that a particular document of text resource in fact represents information about one or more topics. This is used to construct references to actual information in a topic map.

   <p><table><tr><td>
<pre>     
      occurrences:
     
        <var>topic_name</var>::
     
          "<var>URL reference or literal string</var>"
     
              represents = { "<var>sub-topic disambiguator</var>", ... },
              representation = "<var>literal or url</var>";
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

 lvalue::

     "A variable identifier, i.e. the left hand side of an '=' association. The promiser in a variable promise."

   <p><br>

   <p>Occurrences are pointers to information about topics. This might be a literal text string or a URL reference to an external document.

<h4>9.4.1 <code>about_topics</code></h4>

<p><b>Type</b>: slist

<p><b>Allowed input range</b>: (arbitrary string)

<p><b>Synopsis</b>: List of topics that the document or resource addresses

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

<pre>
 "/docs/SpecialTopic_RBAC.html#tag"

     represents => { "Text section" }, 
   about_topics => { "defining roles" };

   <p><i>History</i>: Was introduced in 3.3.0, Nova 2.2.0 (2012)

   <p>As of CFEngine 3.3.0, this represents a list of topics on which the named occurrence provides information.

   <p>History: Previously the context class had been used for this purpose, but this led to confusion between usage or context and the subjects covered by a document.

<h4>9.4.2 <code>represents</code></h4>

<p><b>Type</b>: slist

<p><b>Allowed input range</b>: (arbitrary string)

<p><b>Synopsis</b>: List of explanations for what relationship this document has to the topics it is about

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

<pre>
occurrences:

  Promise_Theory::

    "A theory of autonomous actors that offer certainty through promises"

      represents     => { "Definitions" },
      representation => "literal";

</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>The sub-topic or occurrence-type represented by the document reference in a knowledge base. This string is intended as an annotation to the reader about the nature of the information located in the occurrence document. It should be used `creatively'.

   <p>If the document type is an image and one of the items in this list is a url, beginning with either <samp><span>/</span></samp> or <samp><span>http</span></samp>, then <code>cf-know</code> treats the reference as a url to be reached when the image is clicked on.

<h4>9.4.3 <code>representation</code></h4>

<p><b>Type</b>: (menu option)

<p><b>Allowed input range</b>: <br>
<pre>               <code>literal</code>
               <code>url</code>
               <code>db</code>
               <code>file</code>
               <code>web</code>
               <code>image</code>
               <code>portal</code>
</pre>
   <p><b>Synopsis</b>: How to interpret the promiser string (e.g. actual data or reference to data)

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

<pre>occurrences:

  Promise_Theory::

    "A theory of autonomous actors that offer certainty through promises"

      represents     => { "Definitions" },
      representation => "literal";


</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>This is a form of knowledge representation in a topic map occurrence reference. If the type <code>portal</code> is used it assumes that a new website should open in a new target window.
