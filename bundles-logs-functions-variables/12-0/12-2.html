<h3>12.2 Variable context <code>edit</code></h3>

<p><br>

   <p>This context <samp><span>edit</span></samp> is used to access information about editing promises during their execution. It is context dependent and not universally meaningful or available. For example:

<pre>bundle agent testbundle
{
files:

  "/tmp/testfile"
     edit_line => test;
}

#

bundle edit_line test
{
classes:
    "ok" expression => regline(".*mark.*","$(edit.filename)");

reports:

  ok::
   "File matched $(edit.filename)";
}

</pre>

<p><b>$(edit.filename)</b>

   <p>This variable points to the filename of the file currently making an edit promise. If the file has been arrived at through a search, this could be different from the <samp><span>files</span></samp> promiser.

<ul>
<li><a>Variable edit.filename</a>
</ul>
<div>
<a></a>
<a></a>

</div>
