<h3>11.31 Function host2ip</h3>

<p><b>Synopsis</b>: host2ip(arg1) returns type <b>string</b>

   <p><br>
   <i>arg1</i> : Host name in ascii, <i>in the range</i> .*
<br>

<p>Returns the primary name-service IP address for the named host

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

<pre>
bundle server control
{
allowconnects         => { escape(host2ip("www.example.com")) };
}

</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>Uses whatever configured name service is used by the resolver library to translate a hostname into an IP address. It will return an IPv6 address by preference if such an address exists. This function uses the standard lookup procedure for a name, so it mimics internal processes and can therefore be used not only to cache multiple lookups in the configuration, but to debug the behaviour of the resolver.

   <p><b>History</b>: This function was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4 (2010)
