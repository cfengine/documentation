<p><b>ARGUMENTS</b>:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span>filename</span></samp><dd>The name of a text file containing text to be split up as a list.

     <br><dt><samp><span>comment</span></samp><dd>A regex pattern which specifies comments to be ignored in the file. The <code>comment</code> field will strip out unwanted patterns from the file being read, leaving unstripped characters to be split into fields. The regex is unanchored (See <a>Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions</a>). <b>Note</b> that the text is not treated as a collection of lines, but is read as a single block of <code>maxsize</code> characters, and the regex is applied to that as a single string.

     <br><dt><samp><span>split</span></samp><dd>A regex pattern which is used to parse the field separator(s) to split up the file into items. The <code>split</code> regex is also unanchored.

     <br><dt><samp><span>maxent</span></samp><dd>The maximum number of list items to read from the file

     <br><dt><samp><span>maxsize</span></samp><dd>The maximum number of bytes to read from the file
</dl>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>The following example file would be split into a list of the first ten Greek letters (alpha through kappa).

<pre>     
     alpha beta
     gamma # This is a comment
     delta epsilon zeta
            eta
                   theta
     iota
     kappa          lambda
     mu
