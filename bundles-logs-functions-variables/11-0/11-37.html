<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>This function is only available in commercial releases of CFEngine. It is intended for use in distributed orchestration. It is recommended that you use this function sparingly with <i>guards</i>, as it contributes to network traffic and depends on the network for its function. Unlike <code>remotescalar()</code>, the value of hub-knowledge is not cached.

   <p>This function behaves is essentially similar to the <code>remotescalar</code> function, except that it always gets its information from the policy server hub by an encrypted connection. It is designed for spreading globally calibrated information about a CFEngine swarm back to the client machines. The data available through this channel are generated automatically by discovery, unlike <code>remotescalar</code> which accesses user defined data.

   <p>This function asks for an identifier. It is up to the server to interpret what this means and to return a value of its choosing. If the identifier matches a persistent scalar variable (such as is used to count distributed processes in CFEngine Enterprise) then this will be returned preferentially. If no such variable is found, then the server will look for a literal string in a server bundle with a handle that matches the requested object.
