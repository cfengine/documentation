<p>Get a list of peers (not including ourself) from the partition to which we belong

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

bundle agent peers
{
vars:

  "mygroup" slist => peers("/tmp/hostlist","#.*",4);

  "myleader" string => peerleader("/tmp/hostlist","#.*",4);

  "all_leaders" slist => peerleaders("/tmp/hostlist","#.*",4);

reports:

 linux::

   "mypeer $(mygroup)";
   "myleader $(myleader)";

}

</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p><table><tr><td>
<pre>     
     (slist) peers(<var>file of hosts</var>,<var>comment pattern</var>,<var>group size</var>);
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>This function returns a list of hostnames that may be considered peers of the current host. Peers are defined according to a list of hosts, provided as a file in the first argument. This file should contain a list (one per line), possible with comments, of fully qualified host names. CFEngine breaks up this list into non-overlapping groups of up to <var>groupsize</var>, each of which has a leader that is the first host in the group.

   <p>The current host should belong to this file if it is expected to interact with the others. The function returns nothing if the host does not belong to the list.

<p><b>ARGUMENTS</b>:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span>File of hosts</span></samp><dd>A path to a list of hosts.

     <br><dt><samp><span>Comment pattern</span></samp><dd>A pattern that matches a legal comment in the file. The regex is unanchored, meaning it may match a partial line (see <a>Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions</a>). Comments are stripped as the file is read.

     <br><dt><samp><span>Group size</span></samp><dd>A number between 2 and 64 which represents the number of peers in a peer-group. An arbitrary limit of 64 is set on groups to avoid nonsensical promises. 
</dl>

<pre>     one

     three # this is a comment
     four
     five
     six
     seven
     eight
