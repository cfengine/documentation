<h3>11.32 Function ip2host</h3>

<p><b>Synopsis</b>: ip2host(arg1) returns type <b>string</b>

   <p><br>
   <i>arg1</i> : IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), <i>in the range</i> .*
<br>

<p>Returns the primary name-service host name for the IP address

<p><b>Example</b>:<br>
<br>

<pre>bundle agent reverse_lookup
{
vars:
 "local4" string => ip2host("127.0.0.1");
 "local6" string => ip2host("::1");


reports:
cfengine_3::
  "local4 is $(local4)";
  "local6 is $(local6)";
}
</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>Uses whatever configured name service is used by the resolver library to translate an IP address to a hostname. IPv6 addresses will also resolve, if supported by the resolver library.

   <p>Note that DNS lookups may take time and thus cause CFEngine agents to wait for responses, slowing their progress significantly.

   <p><i>History</i>: Was introduced in version 3.1.3, Nova 2.0.2 (2010)
