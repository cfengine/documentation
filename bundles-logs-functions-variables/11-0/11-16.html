<br>
   <i>arg2</i> : Shell encapsulation option, <i>in the range</i> useshell,noshell
<br>

<p>Execute named command and assign output to variable

bundle agent example

{     
vars:

  "my_result" string => execresult("/bin/ls /tmp","noshell");

reports:

  linux::

    "Variable is $(my_result)";

}

</pre>

<p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
<br>

   <p>The second argument (<samp><span>useshell</span></samp>/<samp><span>noshell</span></samp>) decides whether a shell will be used to encapsulate the command. This is necessary in order to combine commands with pipes etc, but remember that each command requires a new process that reads in files beyond CFEngine's control. Thus using a shell is both a performance hog and a potential security issue.

   <p>Note: you should never use this function to execute commands that make changes to the system, or perform lengthy computations. Such an operation is beyond CFEngine's ability to guarantee convergence, and on multiple passes and during syntax verification these function calls are executed, resulting in system changes that are `covert'. Calls to <code>execresult</code> should be for discovery and information extraction only.

   <p>Note: if the command is not found, the result will be the empty string.

<p><b>Change:</b> policy change in CFEngine 3.0.5. Previously newlines were changed for spaces, now newlines are preserved.
