<h4>7.10.1 <code>build_xpath</code></h4>

<p><b>Type</b>: string

<p><b>Allowed input range</b>: (arbitrary string)

<p><b>Synopsis</b>: Build an XPath within the XML file

   <p>Please note that when <code>build_xpath</code> is defined as an attribute, within an <code>edit_xml</code> promise body, the tree described by the specified XPath will be verified and built BEFORE other <code>edit_xml</code> promises within same promise body. Therefore, the file will not be empty during the execution of such promises.
