<h3>7.16 <code>delete_text</code> promises in <samp><span>edit_xml</span></samp></h3>

<p><br>

   <p>This promise is part of the XML-editing model. It assures that a value string, containing the matching substring, will not be present in the specified node within the XML file. If the substring is found, the default promise is to remove the existing value string, from within the specified node. The specified node is determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal string of text.

   <p><br>

<pre>
bundle edit_xml example
  {
  delete_text:
    "text content to match, as a substring, of text to be deleted from specified node"

    select_xpath => "/Server/Service/Engine/Host/Alias";
  }

</pre>

   <p><br>

   <p>Note that typically, only a single value string, within a single specified node, is deleted in each <code>delete_text</code> promise. You may of course have multiple promises that each delete a value string.
