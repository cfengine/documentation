<h3>7.14 <code>delete_attribute</code> promises in <samp><span>edit_xml</span></samp></h3>

<p><br>

   <p>This promise is part of the XML-editing model. It assures that an attribute, with the given name, will not be present in the specified node within the XML file. If the attribute is found, the default promise is to remove the attribute, from within the specified node. The specified node is determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal string representation of the name of the attribute to be deleted.

   <p><br>

<pre>
bundle edit_xml example
  {
  delete_attribute:
    "name"

    select_xpath => "/Server/Service/Engine/Host";
  }

</pre>

   <p><br>

   <p>Note that typically, only a single attribute, within a single specified node, is deleted in each <code>delete_attribute</code> promise. You may of course have multiple promises that each delete an attribute.
