<h3>7.12 <code>delete_tree</code> promises in <samp><span>edit_xml</span></samp></h3>

<p><br>

   <p>This promise is part of the XML-editing model. It assures that a balanced XML tree, containing the matching subtree, will not be present in the specified node within the XML file. If the subtree is found, the default promise is to remove the containing tree from within the specified node. The specified node is determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal string representation of a balanced XML subtree.

   <p><br>

<pre>
bundle edit_xml example
  {
  delete_tree:
    "Host name=\"cfe_host\">/Host>"

    select_xpath => "/Server/Service/Engine";
  }

</pre>

   <p><br>

   <p>Note that typically, only a single tree, within a single specified node, is deleted in each <code>delete_tree</code> promise. You may of course have multiple promises that each delete a tree.
