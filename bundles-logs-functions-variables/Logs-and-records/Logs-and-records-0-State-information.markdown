### State information

The CFEngine components keep their current process identifier number in
\`pid files' in the work directory. For example:

~~~~ {.verbatim}
cf-execd.pid
cf-serverd.pid
~~~~

Most other state data refer to the running condition of the host and are
generated by `cf-monitord` (`cfenvd` in earlier versions of CFEngine).

state/env\_data

This file contains a list of currently discovered classes and variable
values that characterize the anomaly alert environment. They are altered
by the monitor daemon. \

state/all\_classes

A list of all the classes that were defined the last time that CFEngine
was run. \

state/cf\_\*

All files that begin with this prefix refer to cached data that were
observed by the monitor daemon, and may be used by `cf-agent` in
`reports` with `showstate`.
