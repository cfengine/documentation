CFEngine is a fully distributed system that allows you to define desired states
of everything from very large-scale infrastructures to small devices. The
lightweight c-based cf-agent runs locally on each resource and persistently
tries to converge towards the defined desired state. The actual states of
managed resources are available in logs and an enterprise database for
compliance and easy reporting. Using CFEngine, can be described in the following
3 simple steps.

## 1. Define desired state

As an end-user you can use the CFEngine Domain Specific Language (DSL) to define
desired states. CFEngine allows you to define a variety of states ranging from
process management to software deployment and file integrity. You can check out
CFEngine Promise types to get an idea of the most common states you can define.

Normally, all desired states are stored in `.cf` text-files in the
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles` directory on one or more central distribution points,
referred to as CFEngine Policy Hubs.

## 2. Ensure actual state

CFEngine typically runs locally on each managed resource. A resource can be
anything from a server, network switch, raspberry pi, or any other computational
device. CF-agent, the execution engine, is autonomous which means all the
evaluations occur on the local node.

Before each run, which by default is every 5 minutes, the agent tries to connect
to one of the Policy Hubs to check if there has been any policy updates. Upon
policy updates, cf-agent will download the latest policy to its own
`/var/cfengine/inputs` directory, run a syntax check and upon success start to
execute.

## 3. Verify actual state

Whenever the agent runs, it creates a log of local inventory, system states and
execution results. The logs are stored in `/var/cfengine/outputs`. For enterprise
customers, all data is also stored in a local database. CFEngine also stores a
large number of asset information like software installed, CPU, memory, disk,
network activity, etc. As for execution results, CFEngine can have 3 states:

* **Promise Kept**: Actual state was equal to Desired State

* **Promise Repaired**: Actual state was not equal to Desired State, but the
agent was able to repair the state into compliance

* **Promise not Kept**: Actual state was not equal to Desired state and the
agent was not able to restore into compliance

Thanks to the autonomous nature of CFEngine, systems will be continuously
maintained even if the Server is down. CFEngine agents on the hosts will
opportunistically try to connect to the server. If it fails, last successful
policy will apply, and since all evaluation is local, it doesn't matter if the
characteristics of the host changes and needs to be reconfigured. CFEngine will
figure it out and ensure compliance. CFEngine has been reported to run on many
different platforms in many different environments including traditional
servers, workstations and laptops, network gear (routers/switches), bus and tram
systems, point of sales systems, smart displays/signs, and even submarines.

# Adopting CFEngine
## What does adoption involve?

CFEngine is a framework and a methodology with far reaching implications for the
way you do IT management. The CFEngine approach asks you to think in terms
of promises and cooperation between parts; it automates repair and maintenance
processes and provides simple integrated Knowledge Management.

To use CFEngine effectively, you should spend a little time learning about the
approach to management, as this will save you a lot of time and effort in the
long run.

## The Mission plan

At CFEngine, we refer to the management of your datacentre as *The Mission*. The
diagram below shows the main steps in preparing mission control. Some training
is recommended, and as much planning as you can manage in advance. Once a
mission is underway, you should expect to work by making small corrections to
the mission plan, rather than large risky changes.

![Mission Plan](./adopting-cfengine-mission-plan.png)

Planning does not mean sitting around a table, or in front of a whiteboard.
Successful planning is a dialogue between theory and practice. It should include
test pilots and proof-of-concept implementations.

## Commercial or free?

The first decision you should make is whether you will choose a route of
commercial assistance or manage entirely on your own. You can choose different
levels of assistance, from just training, to consulting, to commercial versions
of the software that simplify certain processes and offer extended features.

At the very minimum, we recommend that you take a training course on CFEngine.
Users who don't train often end up using only a fraction of the software's
potential, and in a sub-optimal way. Think of this as an investment in your
future.

The advantages of the commercial products include greatly simplified set up
procedures, continuous monitoring and automatic knowledge integration. See the
CFEngine Nova Supplement for more information.

## Installation or pilot

You are free to download Community Editions of CFEngine at any time to test the
software. There is a considerable amount of documentation and example policy
available on the cfengine.com web-site to try some simple examples of system
management.

If you intend to purchase a significant number of commercial licenses for
CFEngine software, you can request a pilot process, during which a specialist
will install and demonstrate the commercial edition on site.

## Identifying the team

CFEngine will become a core discipline in your organization, taking you from
reactive fire-fighting to proactive and strategic practices. You should invest
in a team that embraces its methods. The CFEngine team will become the enabler
of business agility, security, reliability and standardization.

The CFEngine team needs to have administrator or super-user access to systems,
and it needs the *headroom* or *slack* to think strategically. It needs to build
up processes and workflows that address quality assurance and minimize the risk
of change.

All teams are important centres for knowledge, and you should provide incentives
to keep the core team strong and in constant dialogue with your organization's
strategic leadership. Treat your CFEngine team as a trusted partner in business.

## Training and certification

Once you have tried the simplest examples using CFEngine, we recommend at least
three days of in-depth training. We can also arrange more in-depth training to
qualify as a CFEngine Mission Specialist.

## Mission goal and knowledge management

The main aim of Knowledge Management is to learn from experience, and use the
accumulated learning to improve the predictability of workflow processes. During
every mission, there will be unexpected events, and an effective team will use
knowledge of past and present to respond to these unpredictable changes with
confidence

The goal of an IT mission is a predictable operational state that lives up to
specific policy-determined promises. You need to work out what this desired
state should be before you can achieve it. No one knows this exactly in advance,
and most organizations will change course over time. However, with good planning
and understanding of the mission, such adjustments to policy can be small and
regular.

Many small changes are less risky than few large changes, and the culture of
agility keeps everyone on their toes. Using CFEngine to run your mission, you
will learn to work pro-actively, adjusting the system by refining the mission
goal rather than reacting to unexpected events.

To work consistently and predictably, even when understaffed, requires a
strategy for describing system resources, policy and state. CFEngine can help
with all of these. See the Special Topics Guide on Knowledge Management.

A major component of a successful mission, is documenting intentions. What is
the goal, and how does it break down into concrete, achievable states? CFEngine
can help you in this process, with training and Professional Services, but you
must establish a culture of commitment to the mission and learn how to express
these commitments in terms of CFEngine promises.

## Build, deploy, manage, audit

The four mission phases are sometimes referred to as

* Build

  A mission is based on decisions and resources that need to be put assembled or
  `built' before they can be applied. This is the planning phase.

  In CFEngine, what you build is a template of proposed promises for the
  machines in an organization such that, if the machines all make and keep these
  promises, the system will function seamlessly as planned. This is how it works
  in a human organization, and this is how is works for computers too.

* Deploy

    Deploying really means launching the policy into production. In CFEngine you
    simply publish your policy (in CFEngine parlance these are `promise
    proposals') and the machines see the new proposals and can adjust
    accordingly. Each machine runs an agent that is capable of keeping the
    system on course and maintaining it over time without further assistance.

* Manage

    Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such incidents
    traditionally set off alarms and humans rush to make new transactions to
    repair them. Under CFEngine guidance, the autonomous agent manages the
    system, and humans only manage knowledge and have to deal with rare events
    that cannot be dealt with automatically.

* Audit

    CFEngine performs continuous analysis and correction, and commercial
    editions generate explicit reports on mission status. Users can sit back and
    examine these reports to check mission progress, or examine the current
    state in relation to the knowledge map for the mission.

# CFEngine architecture and design
CFEngine operates autonomously in a network, under your guidance. While
CFEngine supports anything from 1 servers to 100,000+ servers, the essence of
any CFEngine deployment is the same.

CFEngine supports networks of any size, from a handful of nodes to
hundreds of thousands of computers. It is built to scale. If your site
is very large (many thousands of servers) you should spend some time
discussing your requirements with CFEngine experts. They will know
how to tune promises and configurations to your environment as scale
requires you to have more infrastructure, and a potentially more
complicated configuration. No matter the scale, the essence of any
CFEngine deployment is the same, but with great power comes great
responsibility (a.k.a. don't break things before the weekend, on the
weekend, or in fact on any other day).

CFEngine was designed to enable scalable configuration management in
any kind of environment, with an emphasis on supporting large, Unix-like
systems that are connected via TCP/IP.

CFEngine doesn't depend on or assume the presence of reliable
infrastructure. It works opportunistically in any environment, using
the fewest possible resources, and it has a limited set of software
dependencies. It can run anywhere and this lean approach to
CFEngine's architecture makes it possible to support both traditional
server-based approaches to configuration as well as more novel
platforms for configuration including embedded and mobile systems.

CFEngine's design allows you to create fault-tolerant, available systems
which are independent of external requirements. CFEngine works in all
the places you think it should, and all the new places you haven't even
thought of yet.

## Managing expectations with promises

CFEngine works on a simple notion of **promises**. A promise is the
documentation of an intention to act or behave in some manner. When you make a
promise, it is an effort to improve trust. Trust is an economic time-saver. If
you can't trust you have to verify everything, and that is expensive.

Everything in CFEngine can be thought of as a promise to be kept by different
resources in the system. In a system that delivers a web site with Apache
`httpd`, an important promise may be to make sure that the `httpd` or `apache` package is installed,
running, and accessible on port 80. In a system which needs to satisfy mid-day
traffic on a busy web site, a promise may be to ensure that there are 200
application servers running during normal business hours.

These promises are not top-down directives for a central authority to push
through the system. A large organization can't run on top-down authority
alone. A group of people can't be managed without empowering and trusting them to
make independent decisions.

CFEngine is a system that emphasizes the promises a client makes to the
overall CFEngine network. They are the rules which clients are responsible for
implementing. We can create large systems of scale because we don't create a
bulky centralized authority. There should be no single point-of-failure when
managing machines and people.

Combining promises with patterns to describe where and when promises should
apply is what CFEngine is all about.

## Automation with CFEngine

Users are good at researching solutions and making design decisions, but awful
at repeated execution. Machines are pitiful at making decisions, but very good
at reliable implementation at very large scale. It makes sense to let each
side do the job that they are good at. With CFEngine, users make decisions and
write promises for machines to implement and satisfy.

A CFEngine user will declare a promise in CFEngine, and CFEngine will then
translate this promise into a series of actions to implement. For the most
part, CFEngine understands how to deliver on promises, and they don't need to
be given explicit instructions for completing tasks. It is your job to make
decisions about the systems you are managing and to describe those in suitable
promises. It is CFEngine's job to automate and deliver a promise.

CFEngine is a distributed solution that is completely independent of host
operating systems, network topology or system processes. You describe the
ideal state of a given system by creating promises and the CFEngine agents
ensures that the necessary steps are taken to achieve this state. Automation
in CFEngine is executed through a series of
[components][Overview#CFEngine component applications and daemons] that run locally on hosts.

## Phases of system management

There are four commonly cited phases in managing systems with CFEngine: Build,
Deploy, Manage, and Audit.

### Build

A system is based on a number of decisions and resources that need to be
`built' before they can be implemented. You don't need to decide every detail,
just enough to build trust and predictability into your system. In CFEngine,
what you build is a template of proposed promises for the machines being
managed.  If the machines in a system all make and keep these promises, the
system will function seamlessly as planned.

### Deploy

Deploying really means implementing the policy that was already decided. In
transaction systems, one tries to push out changes one-by-one, hence
`deploying' the decision. In CFEngine you simply publish your policy (in
CFEngine parlance these are "promise proposals") and the machines see the new
proposals and can adjust accordingly. Each machine runs an agent that is
capable of implementing policies and maintaining them over time without
further assistance.

### Manage

Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such incidents
traditionally set off alarms and humans rush to make new transactions to
repair them.  In CFEngine, the autonomous agent manages the system, and you
only have to deal with rare events that cannot be dealt with automatically.
This is the key difference of CFEngine, a focus on autonomy and creating
agents that are smart enough to adapt to changing situations.

### Audit

In traditional configuration systems, the outcome is far from clear after a
one-shot transaction, so one audits the system to determine what actually
happened. In CFEngine, changes are not just initiated once, but locally
audited and maintained. Decision outcomes are assured by design in CFEngine
and maintained automatically, so the main worry is managing conflicting. Users
can sit back and examine regular reports of compliance generated by the
agents, without having to arrange for new transactions to roll-out changes.

You should not think of CFEngine as a roll-out system, i.e. one that attempts
to force out absolute changes and perhaps reverse them in case of error.
Roll-out and roll-back are theoretically flawed concepts that only sometimes
work in practice. With CFEngine, you publish a sequence of policy revisions,
always moving forward (because like it or not, time only goes in one
direction). All of the desired-state changes are managed locally by each
individual host, and continuously repaired to ensure on-going compliance
with policy.
