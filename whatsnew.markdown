CFEngine 3.5 is the latest version of CFEngine 3. It enables Infrastructure
Engineers to automate IT systems easier, faster and at a greater
scale than ever before. CFEngine 3.5 allows you to address the challenges
that come with managing very large and complex IT infrastructure
installations when agility, scalability, security and stability are critical,
in spite of platform diversity.

## CFEngine Design Center

Infrastructure Engineers can boost productivity using the ready-made sketches
from the **TODO:[CFEngine Design Center](manuals-design-center.html)**. These components
allow you to roll out of data-driven configuration changes, without having to
worry about the details of the policy language. Enterprise customers can
use the Design Center UI from within the Mission Portal, which makes building
and adjusting infrastructure as simple as a mouse click.

## Multi-Site Scalability

Large CFEngine installations can grow to well over 100.000 hosts distributed
over multiple sites, and there is no upper limit to the scalability. CFEngine
3.5 introduces **TODO:[multi-site reporting](manuals-multi-site-reporting.html)**,
which enables centralized collection of information from an arbitrary number
of CFEngine 3 Enterprise sites.

## More control for CFEngine operators

Operators of CFEngine installations benefit from the improved tooling for
diagnosing and controlling their system. Enterprise customers get comprehensive
**diagnostics data** about the performance of their server's data collection,
and can **fine-tune the data collection** volume through policy language.
**TODO:** links to cf-agent --self-diagnostics, hub diagnostics and server config
for data collection
