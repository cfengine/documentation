CFEngine 3.5 is the latest version of CFEngine 3. It enables Infrastructure
Engineers to automate IT systems easier, faster and at a greater
scale than ever before. CFEngine 3.5 allows you to manage very large and 
complex IT infrastructure installations when agility, scalability, security 
and stability are critical.

CFEngine 3.5 is compatible with all previous versions of CFEngine 3. Don't 
have CFEngine yet? [**Get started with CFEngine Enterprise in 15 minutes**][evaluate cfengine]!

## Easier to Use

No matter if you are just starting with configuration management and system 
automation, if you are a CFEngine novice or a battle-hardened policy coder, 
the new features in CFEngine 3.5 will make it easy for you to get stuff done.

### Design Center, with UI in CFEngine Enterprise


CFEngine Enterprise 3.5 includes the brand-new **Design Center app** in the 
Mission Portal. You are now able to conveniently configure and activate
sketches through an easy to use graphical interface, and to follow up on
the activation progress.

### Significantly improved parsing and evaluation of policies

A large number of parser and evaluation problems have been fixed. Iterating 
over **arrays with nested lists** has caused many headaches and workarounds in 
previous versions of CFEngine. With 3.5, many of those can disappear.

Policy developers get **clear and consistent messages** from the 
**stricter parser**. `cf-promises` allowing partial check of policy - now you 
are not required to have `body common control` to check syntax. This will 
allow better integration with editors to perform automatic syntax validation.

**Note:** If your policy has syntactically incorrect code, then the new parser 
will mark those as errors. Fixing those errors should be straight forward, but 
see the respective section in [Known Issues][known issues] for information.

`action_policy => warn` now sets `not_kept` classes, which allows you to see 
deeper than first order changes that might occur during **dry-runs**.

The **new `scope` attribute** in `classes` bodies allows policy writers to set 
non global classes based on result of a promise. This reduces managing class 
naming conflicts, especially when multiple activations of a bundle may happen. 

Significant enhancements to bundle common paths, including the ability to
test with automatically defined classes. Policy writers don't have to maintain 
their own common paths locations, or hard code paths into each bundle for 
paths that are well known.

CFEngine operators benefit from a range of improvements in **logging output**, 
both to the syslog and to the standard output.

### New built-in functions and capabilities

A broad range of new built-in functions simplify the coding of policies
significantly and offer completely new functionality.

* set operation functions that test for set membership and find
    intersections/differences:
    * [`every()`][every]
    * [`none()`][none]
    * [`some()`][some]
    * [`intersection()`][intersection]
    * [`difference()`][difference]
* list functions  to look up a specific element, find the list length, extract 
  a portion of the list, reduce it to unique element, sort it, and filter it
    * [`nth()`][nth]
    * [`length()`][length]
    * [`sublist()`][sublist]
    * [`unique()`][unique]
    * [`sort()`][sort]
    * [`shuffle()`][shuffle]
    * [`filter()`][filter]
* function that returns a list of all the classes that match a regular
  expression
    * [`classesmatching()`][classesmatching]
* function that converts date/time values into a formatted string
    * [`strftime()`][strftime]
* function for building a string from data, using sprintf semantics
    * [`format()`][format]
* function for making logical decisions in a function call based on classes
    * [`ifelse()`][ifelse]
* mapping function for arrays
    * [`maparray()`][maparray]
* function for getting detailed file information
    * [`filestat()`][filestat]

### Improved out-of-the-box installation

In CFEngine Enterprise, the CFEngine Server and the Mission Portal UI are all 
up and running as soon as the package installation is completed. CFEngine will
take over from there, and continue to maintain a healthy Server configuration 
through policy.

**New bootstrap semantics** makes bootstrapping simpler. **avahi auto
discovery** is available now in addition to specifying a static ip. Clearer
messages during the bootstrapping process makes it easier to analyze why
things might not have worked.

## Report collection at arbitrary scale

### Scalability across multiple sites

Support for [**Multi-Site Querying**][Multi-Site Queries] enables the 
generation of reports across multiple, globally distributed CFEngine Server 
installations, and the centralized aggregation of data collected.

Improved performance of `cf-serverd` allows the handling of more connections 
in parallel, resulting in faster policy distribution through the network.

### Improved SQL reporting

All **CFEngine reports** are now based on **SQL syntax**. Run one of our
ready-made reports with a single click, or define your own using the graphical 
query  builder or direct SQL input. Save and schedule your reports in a quick 
and easy way.

* Promise logs, file, software and compliance information are available
  through **SQL Report app**
* Regular expressions are supported in SQL queries
* [**Enterprise API**][Enterprise API] supports host
  and promise filtering

## Better tools for CFEngine operators

* CFEngine Enterprise collects data for diagnostics, available through SQL 
queries
    * performance data from MongoDB
    * [lastseen report data][SQL Schema#Database Diagnostics] for information
      about host connectivity
    * [`FirstReportTimeStamp`][SQL Schema#Hosts] is recorded for all hosts
    * [Performance data][SQL Schema#hub diagnostics] from `cf-hub`
* Configurable data collection for Enterprise
    * Host-side report content filter, controlled by `report_data_select` body
   in [access promise][access#report_data_select]
    * filters for class, variable, promise log and monitoring reports
* [Self-diagnostics][cf-agent#Command Reference] of a CFEngine agent 
  installation

## Streamlined Mission Portal

The Mission Portal has received another **major facelift** for this release. 
Plenty of polish went into the visual and interaction design.

![New Mission Portal UI](new-mission-portal-ui.png)

**Host categorizations** (aka navigation trees) has received a performance 
boost, and can now be shared between users. Partition your system any way you 
like, save your categorization, and give others access. Or simply add othersâ€™ 
categorizations to your own account.

## Microsoft Windows specific improvements

* Windows PowerShell support in [`commands` promises][commands],
  [`execresult()`][execresult] and [`returnszero()`][returnszero]
* Improved ACL handling on Windows
   * Note the [syntax changes][files#acl_default] in the
     [ChangeLog][New in CFEngine#changelog]
