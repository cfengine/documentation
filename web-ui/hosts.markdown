The Hosts app provides a customizable global overview of _promise_ compliance. A summary of compliant vs non-compliant hosts is provided at each branch in the tree.

Each host is in one of two groups: out of compliance or fully compliant.

* A host is considered out of compliance if less than 100% of its promises were kept.
* A host is considered fully compliant if 100% of its promises were kept.

A host tree based on OS (Operating system) is present by default. Host trees map hosts based on reported classes into a hierarchy. Additional host trees can be added based on classes, which could be used to view different perspectives such as geographic location, production tier, business unit, etc.... Furthermore, Each host tree can be shared based on Mission Portal role.
