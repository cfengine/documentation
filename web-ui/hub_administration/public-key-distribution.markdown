> How can I arrange for the hosts in my infrastructure to trust a new key?

If you are deploying a new hub, or authorizing a non-hub to copy files from
peers you will need to establish trust before communication can be established.

In order for trust to be established each host must have the public key of the
other host stored in `$(sys.ppkeys)` named for the public key sha.

For example, we have 2 hosts. host001 with public key sha
`SHA=917962161107efaed9610de3e034085373142f577fb7e7b9bddec2955b748836` and hub
with public key sha
`SHA=af00250085306c68bb6d5f489f0239e2d7ff8a1f53f2d00e77c9ad2044309dfe`. For
trust to be established `host001` must have
`$(sys.workdir)/ppkeys/root-SHA=af00250085306c68bb6d5f489f0239e2d7ff8a1f53f2d00e77c9ad2044309dfe.pub`
and hub must have
`$(sys.workdir)/ppkeys/root-SHA=917962161107efaed9610de3e034085373142f577fb7e7b9bddec2955b748836.pub`.
The files must be root owned with write access restricted to the owner (644 or
less).

This policy shows how public keys can be stored in a central location on the
policy server and automatically installed on all hosts.
