which are logged in.

`$(sys.workdir)/httpd/htdocs/application/modules/files/static_files` on your
hub. Access the content using the url https://hub/files/view/file_name.html,
where `file_name.html` is the name of a file. Please note, uploaded files should
have read permission for `cfapache` user.

## Custom help menu entries

The help menu Mission portal help menu. It can be useful if you would like to
make extra content like documentation easily avilable to users.

### How to use

Upload html files into
`$(sys.workdir)/httpd/htdocs/application/views/extraDocs/` on your hub. Menu
items will appear named for each html file where underscores are replaced with
spaces. Files must be readable by the `cfapache` user.


### Example

<img src="extended-menu.png" alt="Extended menu" width="300px">

### Mission Portal Style

of Mission Portal.

```html file=file_name.html
<div class="contentWrapper help">
    <div class="pageTitle">
        <h1>PAGE TITLE</h1>
    </div>

     <!-- CONTENT --->
