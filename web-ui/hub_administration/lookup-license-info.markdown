Information about the currently issued license can be obtained from the About section in Mission Portal web interface or from the command line as shown here.

**Note:** When the CFEngine Enterprise license expires
**report collection** is limited. No agent side
functionality is changed. However if you are using
functions or features that rely on information collected
by the hub, that information will no longer be a reliable
source of data.

# Get license info via API

Run from the hub itself.

```console
$ curl -u admin http://localhost/api/
```

# Get license info from cf-hub

Run as `root` from the hub itself.

```console
[root@hub ~]# cf-hub --show-license
