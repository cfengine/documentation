* Each alert also has a **Condition type**:
	* **Policy** conditions trigger alerts based on CFEngine policy compliance status. They can be set on bundles, promisees, and promises. If nothing is specified, they will trigger alerts for all policy.

	* **Inventory** conditions trigger alerts for inventory attributes. These attributes correspond to the ones found in inventory reports.

	* **Software Updates** conditions trigger alerts based on packages available for update in the repository. They can be set either for a specific version or trigger on the latest version available. If neither a package nor a version is specified, they will trigger alerts for any update.

	* **Custom SQL** conditions trigger alerts based on an SQL query. The SQL query must returns at least one column - `hostkey`.

* Alert conditions can be limited to a subset of hosts.
