CFEngine is a configuration management system that provides a framework for automated management of IT infrastructure.

CFEngine is decentralized and highly scalable. It is powered by autonomous agents that can continuously monitor, self-repair, and update or restore an entire IT system, with negligible impact on system resources or performance.
