These instructions describe how to install the latest version of CFEngine Enterprise in a production environment
using pre-compiled rpm and deb packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, CentOS, and SUSE.

## General Requirements

CFEngine recommends the following:

**Host Memory**

During normal operation the CFEngine processes consume about 30 MB of resident memory (RSS) on hosts
with the agent only (not acting as Policy Server).

However there might be spikes due to e.g. commands executed from the CFEngine policy so it is generally
recommended to have at least 256 MB available memory in order to run the CFEngine agent software.

**Host disk**

On Unix-like systems, CFEngine can consume up to 100 MB of the partition mounted where CFEngine is installed
(usually /var/cfengine). On Windows systems, CFEngine can consume up to 1GB (usually C:\Program Files\Cfengine).
The higher disk usage on Windows is due to lack of support for sparse files on this platform, which is
utilized by a dependency of CFEngine (lmdb) when available.

Maximum disk space used by diff reports (contexts, variables, software installed, software patches,
lastseen hosts and promise executions) can be set as max_client_history_size variable
located in masterfiles/def.cf.

**Network**

* Verify that the machineâ€™s network connection is working and that port 5308
  (used by CFEngine) is open for both incoming and outgoing connections.

* If a firewall is active on your operating system, adapt it to
  it to allow for communication on port 5308 or disable it.

CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies into the package; therefore,
additional software is not required.

**Requirements for VIOS**

CFEngine Enterprise has [Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) Recognized status](http://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=48493) from IBM.
This means that CFEngine Enterprise has been technically verified by IBM
to be installed in and manage VIOS environments.

During testing, CFEngine Enterprise was seen to use up to 2% of the VIOS CPU
during `cf-agent` runs with the default CFEngine policy. The resource
utilization may vary depending on the policy CFEngine is running.
The VIOS should be configured with Shared Processors in Uncapped mode.

## Policy Server Requirements

Please note that the resource requirements below are meant as minimum guidelines and have been obtained with syntethic testing, and it is always better to leave some headroom if intermittent bottlenecks should occur.
The key drivers for the vertical scalability of the Policy Servers are 1) the number of agents bootstrapped and 2) the size and complexity of the CFEngine policy.

### cfapache and cfpostgres users

The CFEngine Server requires two users: **cfapache** and **cfpostgres**.
If these users do not exist during installation of the server package, they will be created,
so if there are constraints on user creation, please ensure that these
users exists prior to installation.

These users are not required nor created by the agent package.

### Dedicated OS

The CFEngine Server is only supported when installed on a **dedicated,
vanilla OS** (i.e. it only has repositories and packages officially
supported by the OS vendor). This is because the CFEngine Server uses
services, e.g. apache, that are configured for CFEngine and may
conflict with other custom application configurations.

One option, especially for smaller installations, is to run the
CFEngine Server in a VM. But please consider the performance
requirements when doing this.


### CPU

A modern 64-bit processor with 12 or more cores for handling up to 5000 bootstrapped agents.
This number is also linear with respect to the number of bootstrapped agents (so 6 cores would suffice for 2500 agents).


### Memory

Minimum 2GB memory, but not lower than **8MB per bootstrapped agent**. This means that, for a server with 5000 hosts, you should have at least 40GB of memory.


### Disk sizing and partitioning

It is recommended that /var/cfengine/state/pg is mounted on a **separate disk**. This will give PostgreSQL, which is very disk I/O intensive, dedicated resources.

Plan for approximately **100MB of disk space per bootstrapped agent**.
This means that, for a server with 5000 hosts, you should have at least 500 GB available on the database partition.

xfs is strongly recommended as the file system type for the file system mounted on /var/cfengine/state/pg. ext4 can be used as an alternative, but ext3 should be avoided.


### Disk speed

For 5000 bootstrapped agents, the disk that serves PostgreSQL (/var/cfengine/state/pg) should be able to perform at least **1000 IOPS** (in 16KiB block size) and 10 MB/s. The disk mounted on /var/cfengine should be able to perform at least 500 IOPS and 0.5 MB/s. **SSD is recommmended** for the disk that serves PostgreSQL (/var/cfengine/state/pg).

If you do not have separate partitions for /var/cfengine and /var/cfengine/state/pg, the speed required by the disk serving /var/cfengine adds up (for 5000 bootstrapped agents it would be 1500 IOPS and 10.5 MB/s).

**Note** Your storage IOPS specification may be given in 4KiB block size, in which case you would need to divide it by 4 to get the corresponding 16KiB *theoretical maximum*.


### Network

For serving policy and collecting reports for up to 5000 bootstrapped agents, plan for at least 30 MB/s (240 MBit) speed on the interface that connects the Policy Server with the agents.


### Open file descriptors

The policy server should ideally be able to accept connections from all clients; i.e. to allow at least as many incoming connections as there are clients.
The system limit for this is controlled by `ulimit -n`; so the parent process from which you bootstrap should, for a server with 5000 hosts, run `ulimit -n 5000` first.
You should also add such a `ulimit -n` command to the script that implements `service cfengine3 start` (and `restart`) and to any policy that starts `cf-serverd` or `cf-hub`.
For very large numbers of clients, it may be advantageous to build a custom kernel to allow setting `ulimit -n` high enough.
You should also amend the value of `maxconnections` set in `cf_serverd.cf` under `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/controls/` to the number of clients, likewise.


## Download Packages

## Install Packages

CFEngine Enterprise is provided in two packages; one is for the Policy
Server (hub) and the other is for each Host (client).

**Log in as root** and then follow these steps to install CFEngine Enterprise:


1. On the designated Policy Server, install the `cfengine-nova-hub` package:

    ```
        [RedHat/CentOS/SUSE] # rpm -i <hub package>.rpm
        [Debian/Ubuntu]      # dpkg -i <hub package>.deb
    ```

2. On each Host, install the `cfengine-nova` package:

    ```
        [RedHat/CentOS/SUSE] # rpm -i <agent package>.rpm
        [Debian/Ubuntu]      # dpkg -i <agent package>.deb
        [Solaris]            # pkgadd -d <agent package>.pkg all
        [AIX]                # installp -a -d <agent package>.bff cfengine.cfengine-nova
        [HP-UX]              # swinstall -s <full path to agent package>.depot cfengine-nova
    ```

Note: Install actions logged to `/var/logs/cfengine-install.log`.

## Bootstrap

Run the bootstrap command, **first** on the policy server and then on each
host:

```
$ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap <IP address of the Policy Server>
```

## Licensed installations

If you are evaluating CFEngine Enterprise or otherwise using it in an environment with
less than 25 agents connecting to a Policy Server,
you do not need a license and there is no expiry.

If you are a customer, please send the Policy Server's public key (`/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub`) to
CFEngine support to obtain a license. CFEngine will send you a `license.dat`
file. Copy the obtained license file to
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles/license.dat`

## Next Steps

When bootstrapping is complete, CFEngine is up and running on your system.

The Mission Portal is immediately accessible. Connect to the Policy Server
through your web browser at http://`<IP address of your Policy Server>`.
