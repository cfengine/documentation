## What are reports?

Reports are the records that the components ( `cf-agent`, `cf-monitord`,
`cf-serverd` ... ) record about their knowledge of the system state. Each
component may log to various data sources within `$(sys.statedir)`.

## How does CFEngine Enterprise collect reports?

`cf-hub` makes connections from the hub to remote agents currently registered in
the lastseen database (viewable with ```cf-key -s```)
on [`body hub control port`][body hub control port] (5308 by default). The hub
tries to collect from up to the LICENSED number of hosts for each collection
round as identified by `hub_schedule` as defined
in [`body hub control`](cf-hub#control-promises).

* **See Also:** `hostsseen()`, `hostswithclass()`

## How often does cf-hub re-check the LICENSE

{% comment %}cf-hub/license-checking.c:#define SECONDS_BETWEEN_CHECKS (5 * SECONDS_PER_MINUTE){% endcomment %}
`cf-hub` re-checks the license when it is started and once every 5 minutes after
that.

## Which hosts are being report-collected?

`cf-hub` gets a list of hosts to collect from `lastseen` database
(viewable with `cf-key -s`).

**NOTE:** this database is periodically cleaned from entries older
than one week old.

This cleanup is tweakable using `lastseenexpireafter` setting.
However we don't recommend tweaking this setting, as older hosts are
practically dead, and may affect report collection performance (via
timeouts) and license-counting.

## How does the license count affect report collection?

In each collection round, `cf-hub` will collect reports from up to
LICENSED number of hosts. It is unspecified which hosts are the ones
skipped, in case the total number of hosts listed in `lastseen` database
are over the LICENSED number.

### Can cf-hub host count be different from Mission Portal ?

Yes, it can be.
Mission Portal only sees the hosts which `cf-hub` has put into the PostgreSQL database.
`cf-hub` can skip hosts for a few reasons, for example if they are in [`exclude_hosts`](cf-hub#exclude_hosts), or if it has reached the license count.
Thus, it is possible to appear to be within license count in Mission Portal, but cf-hub is detecting that you are over license.
If you believe you should be within license count, the [Host DELETE API]([Host REST API#Remove host from the hub]) can be used to remove old / inactive hosts.

## When is a hub behaving as **over-licensed** ?

When the number of hosts in the `lastseen` database (viewable with
`cf-key -s`) is greater than the number of LICENSED hosts for this hub.

## How are agents not running determined?
Hosts who's last agent execution status is "FAIL" will show up under "Agents not
running". A hosts last agent execution status is set to "FAIL" when the hub
notices that there are no promise results within 3x of the expected agent run
interval. The agents average run interval is computed by a geometric average
based on the 4 most recent agent executions.

![Agents not running](agents-not-running.png)

You can inspect hosts last execution time, execution status (from the hubs
perspective), and average run interval using the following SQL.

```sql
SELECT Hosts.HostName AS "Host name",
AgentStatus.LastAgentLocalExecutionTimeStamp AS "Last agent local execution
time", cast(AgentStatus.AgentExecutionInterval AS integer) AS "Agent execution
interval", AgentStatus.LastAgentExecutionStatus AS "Last agent execution status"
FROM AgentStatus INNER JOIN Hosts ON Hosts.HostKey = AgentStatus.HostKey
```

This can be queried over the API most easily by placing the query into a json
file. And then using the `query` API.

`agent_execution_time_interval_status.query.json`:

```
{
  "query": "SELECT Hosts.HostName, AgentStatus.LastAgentLocalExecutionTimeStamp, cast(AgentStatus.AgentExecutionInterval AS integer), AgentStatus.LastAgentExecutionStatus FROM AgentStatus INNER JOIN Hosts ON Hosts.HostKey = AgentStatus.HostKey"
}
```

```console
$ curl -s -u admin:admin http://hub/api/query -X POST -d @agent_execution_time_interval_status.query.json | jq ".data[0].rows"
[
  [
    "hub",
    "2016-07-25 16:53:23+00",
    "296",
    "OK"
  ],
  [
    "host001",
    "2016-07-25 16:06:50+00",
    "305",
    "FAIL"
  ]
]
```

## How are hosts not reporting determined?

Hosts that have not been collected from within `blueHostHorizon` seconds will
show up under "Hosts not reporting".

![Hosts not reporting](hosts-not-reporting.png)

`blueHostHorizon` defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes). You can inspect the
current value of `blueHostHorizon` from Mission Portal or via the API:

```console
$ curl -s -u admin:admin http://hub/api/settings/ | jq ".data[0].blueHostHorizon"
900
```

Note: It's called "blueHostHorizon" because older versions of Mission Portal
would turn these hosts to a blue color as an indication of "hypoxia" (lack
of oxygen, where oxygen is access to latest policy) to indicate a health issue.

**See Also**: `Enterprise API Reference`, `Enterprise API Examples`, [Enterprise Settings][Settings#preferences]

## Are there supposed to be so many cf-consumer processes?

Yes, `cf-consumer` will spawn 25 threads for report collection processing.

## Which hosts are pending trust revocation?

When a host is removed using the delete API its key is placed in a queue for
trust revocation. To see which hosts are pending key removal use the following
query against the ```cfsettings``` database.

```sql
SELECT HostKey FROM KeysPendingForDeletion;
```

## How to troubleshoot report collection?

The following steps can be used to help diagnose and potentially restore
reporting for hosts experiencing issues.

### Perform manual delta collection for a single host

Performing back to back delta collections and comparing the data received can
help to expose so called *patching* issues. If the same amount of data is
collected twice a **rebase** may resolve it.

```console
[root@hub ~]# cf-hub -q delta -H 192.168.33.2 -v

### Perform manual rebase collection for a single host

A `rebase` causes the hub to throw away all reports since the last collection
and collect only the output from the most recent run.

```console
[root@hub ~]# cf-hub -q rebase -H 192.168.33.2 -v
 verbose: ----------------------------------------------------------------
 verbose:  Initialization preamble 
 verbose: ----------------------------------------------------------------
 # <snipped for brevity>

```

**Note:** The Enterprise hub automatically schedules rebase queries if it has
been unable to collect from a given candidate for `client_history_timeout`
hours.

If a manual rebase collection does not restore reporting functionality for a
host continue on to restarting the report collection components.

### Restart report collection components

Sometimes it is necessary to restart the report collection subsystem in order to
re-synchronize the caching layer with the database. To restart the report
collection subsystem simply kill `cf-hub`, `cf-consumer`, `redis-server`, and
run the update policy.

For systemd hosts this can be accomplished by simply restarting the `cf-hub`
service. The related component restarts are automatically handled via the unit
dependencies:

```console
[root@hub ~]# systemctl restart cf-hub
```

For non-systemd hosts:

```console
[root@hub ~]# pkill cf-consumer
[root@hub ~]# pkill cf-hub
[root@hub ~]# pkill redis-server
[root@hub ~]# cf-agent -KIf update.cf

```
