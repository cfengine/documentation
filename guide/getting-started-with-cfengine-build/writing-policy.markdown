Now that we are familiar with how CFEngine works, and how you can use modules and the web UI, let's take a look at policy.
CFEngine policy language is a flexible, declarative language for describing the desired state of your infrastructure (or individual host).

To start, create a new file and open it, or the folder, in your editor:

```
$ cd ~/cfengine_project
$ touch my_policy.cf
$ code .
```

(Here we are using `code` - VS Code, but you can use whatever editor you want).

## Hello, world

Let's take a look at the traditional "Hello, world!" example:

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  files:
    "/tmp/hello"
      content => "Hello, world!";
}
```

The policy above will create and write `Hello, world!` to the `/tmp/hello` file, if necessary.
If that file already exists, with the correct content, nothing is done.

In CFEngine, a `bundle` is a collection of promises, _things_ you want to be true, your desired state.
In the example above, `agent` specifies which component this is for, the `agent` is the binary which makes changes to the system, (as opposed to the file server or other parts of CFEngine).
`main` is the name of the bundle, and has a special meaning, the name bundle will be run by default.
The promise type, `files` in this case, is the type of resource we want to manage.
With `files` promises you can manipulate file permissions, edit lines, render templates to files, copy files around, etc.

If you are just using 1 policy file, you can run the example above from the command line, however, our project has many policy files, and we cannot have many `main` bundles, so we need to change that:

```cfengine3
bundle agent hello_world
{
  meta:
    "tags"
      slist => { "autorun" };

  files:
    "/tmp/hello"
      content => "Hello, world!";
}
```

By changing the name of the bundle to something unique, `hello_world`, and adding the `autorun` tag to the metadata, we can now include the file in our project.
The bundles tagged `autorun` will be run automatically, regardless of their name.
Put the code snippet above in a file called `my_policy.cf`, and add it to the project:

```
$ cfbs add ./my_policy.cf
```

Now, build and deploy again:

```
$ cfbs build
$ cf-remote deploy
```

The policy has been deployed and that `/tmp/hello` file should be ready.
You can log in with SSH to check this, or use `cf-remote`:

```
$ cf-remote sudo -H hub "cat /tmp/hello"
root@192.0.2.2: 'cat /tmp/hello' -> 'Hello, world!'
```

## Running the agent

The agent, an executable called `cf-agent`, is the component which reads your policy files and makes changes to your systems.
When we ran the deploy command, the agent was ran automatically, but you can also run it manually.
For example, you can test that your policy works:

```
$ cf-remote sudo -H hub "rm /tmp/hello && /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -KI"
```

`rm /tmp/hello` deletes the file, causing the agent to recreate it.

## Git promises

Earlier in this tutorial series, we added the `promise-type-git` module to our project.
This means that we can just start using the new promise type in policy:

```cfengine3
bundle agent hello_world
{
  meta:
    "tags"
      slist => { "autorun" };

  git:
    "/tmp/hugo"
      repository => "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git",
      version => "master";
}
```

This policy uses the `git` promise type to clone the Hugo project's source code from GitHub.
Again, put the code snippet above in the `my_policy.cf` file, build, and deploy:

```
$ cfbs build && cf-remote deploy
```

From now on, feel free to put each example in the `my_policy.cf`, and run the command to build and deploy it.
Since it's the same every time, we won't mention it again and again.

## Variables

The promise type `vars` is used for storing data in a variable internally.
This has several benefits:

* The data, such as a string, gets a short and descriptive name
* It can be defined in one place, and edited there without having to update multiple places
* Gives you more flexibiltiy for manipulating the data, with functions and intermediate variables

Here is a simple example:

```cfengine3
bundle agent hello_world
{
  meta:
    "tags"
      slist => { "autorun" };

  vars:
    "github_path"
      string => "/tmp/github.com";

  files:
    "$(github_path)/." # /. means a folder
      create => "true";

  git:
    "$(github_path)/hugo"
      repository => "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git",
      version => "master";
}
```

In the above example, both `git` and `files` promises use the `github_path` variable.
The `files` promise is responsible for creating the parent directory, the `git` promise for cloning inside of it.

## Tags, functions, and reporting

We might want to have some version information on which hugo we are using.
Since we clone and track the `master` branch, there isn't necessarily a version number available, but there is always a commit SHA, so let's look for that.
From the command line, you could find this by:

```
$ git log -1 --format="%H"
```

We want to put this in a variable and include it in our reports we can see in Mission Portal.
To take the output of a command and put it in a variable, we will use the `execresult()` function:

```cfengine3
bundle agent hello_world
{
  meta:
    "tags"
      slist => { "autorun" };

  vars:
    "github_path"
      string => "/tmp/github.com";

    "hugo_path"
      string => "$(github_path)/hugo";

    "hugo_commit"
      string => execresult('cd "$(hugo_path)" && git log -1 --format="%H"', "useshell"),
      meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=Hugo commit" },
      if => fileexists("$(hugo_path)/.git");

  files:
    "$(github_path)/." # /. means a folder
      create => "true";

  git:
    "$(hugo_path)"
      repository => "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git",
      version => "master",
      if => fileexists("$(github_path)");
}
```

`if => fileexists()` was added to ensure the order of things; we want `git clone` to happen when the parent directory exists, and we want `git log` to happen after `git clone`, so when the `.git` folder is there.
Generally speaking, CFEngine does not evaluate the policy from top to bottom, so if you want some things to happen after other things, you should ensure this, for example with an `if`.
By adding `meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=Hugo commit" },` to the variable, we are saying that we want this as an inventory attribute, a part of the reporting data, and we want the attribute name, shown in the Web UI and reports, to be _Hugo commit_.
And indeed, after deploying this policy, we can see it show up in _Inventory reports_:

**Tip:** CFEngine's reporting happens on a schedule, so it might take some minutes for this new inventory attribute to appear for the first time.
To speed it up, you can click the hostname to go to the host info page, and the _Play_ button in the top right corner to trigger an extra agent run and report collection.

## Next steps

This is by no means a complete guide to policy writing, but should give you an idea of how to use modules, and get started building and experimenting.
Next, we will look at implementing modules, such as the git promise type we used here:
