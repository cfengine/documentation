It is common to integrate CFEngine with external data sources. External data
sources could be hand edited data files, the cached result of an API call or
generated by other tooling. This is especially useful for integrating CFEngine
with other infrastructure components like a CMDB.

CFEngine can load structured data defined in JSON, YAML, CSV using the
`readjson()`, `readyaml()`, `readcsv()` and `readdata()` functions or by custom
parsing with `data_resdstringarray()` and `data_readstringarrayidx()`.

Additionally CFEngine provides the [augments file][Augments] as a way to define variables
and classes that are available from the beginning of policy evaluation.

The augments file can be distributed globally as part of your policy by creating
`def.json` in the root of your masterfiles, or it could be generated by the
agent itself for use in subsequent runs.

If the augments file is generated on the agent itself we recommend doing so from
a separate policy like `update.cf`.
