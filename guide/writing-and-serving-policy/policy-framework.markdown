The CFEngine policy framework is called the **Masterfiles Policy Framework**,
**MPF**, or simply **masterfiles** because the files live in
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles` on the policy server (on the clients, and
note the policy server is typically also a client, they are cached in
`/var/cfengine/inputs`).

The following configuration files are part of the default CFEngine
installation in `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`, and have special roles.

The Masterfiles Policy Framework is continually updated. You can track
its development on
[github](https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles/). Notable changes
to the framework are documented in the changelog.

## Setting up ##

First, review `update_def` and `def`.  Most settings you need to
change will live here.

As of CFEngine version 3.7 it is allowed (and recommended) to use
`def.json` to specify things traditionally set in `update.cf` and
`def.cf`.

We will cover the policy in the order it is activated, starting with
the update.cf and its bundlesequence followed by promises.cf and
its bundlesequence.

### update.cf

Synchronizing clients with the policy server happens here, in
`update.cf`. Its main job is to copy all the files on the policy
server (usually the hub) under `$(sys.masterdir)` (usually
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles`) to the local host into `$(sys.inputdir)`
(usually `/var/cfengine/inputs`).

This file should rarely if ever change. Should you ever change it (or
when you upgrade CFEngine), take special care to ensure the old and
the new CFEngine can parse and execute this file successfully. If not,
you risk losing control of your system (that is, **if CFEngine cannot
successfully execute `update.cf`, it has no mechanism for distributing
new policy files**).

By default, the policy defined in update.cf is executed at the
beginning of a `cf-execd` scheduled agent run (see `schedule` and
`exec_command` as defined in `body executor control` in
`controls/cf_execd.cf`). When the update policy completes
(regardless of success or failure) the policy defined in `promises.cf`
is activated.

This is a standalone policy file. You can actually run it with
`cf-agent -KI -f ./update.cf` but if you don't understand what that
command does, please hold off until you've gone through the CFEngine
documentation. The contents of `update.cf` duplicate other things
under `lib` sometimes, in order to be completely standalone.

To repeat, when `update.cf` is broken, things go bonkers. CFEngine
will try to run a backup `failsafe.cf` you can find in the C core
under `libpromises/failsafe.cf` (that `.cf` file is written into the C
code and can't be modified). If things get to that point, you probably
have to look at why corrupted policies made it into production.

As is typical for CFEngine, the policy and the configuration are
mixed. In `update.cf` you'll find some very useful settings. Keep
referring to `update.cf` as you read this.  We are skipping the
nonessential ones.

#### How it works ####

There are multiple stages in `update.cf`. This document covers each
bundle in the order defined by the bundlesequence.

#### update_def (bundle)

This bundle is defined in
`controls/update_def.cf`.
`bundle common update_def` defines settings and variables that are
used throughout the update policy.

As of CFEngine version 3.7 it is recommended that these setting
changes are specified in `def.json` to ease policy framework updates.

##### input_name_patterns (variable)

A list of regular expressions defining which files should be considered
for copying during update.

##### masterfiles_perms_mode (variable)

Usually you want to leave this at `0600` meaning the inputs will be
readable only by their owner.

##### trigger_upgrade (class)

Off by default

When this class is set, the internal CFEngine upgrade mechanism is
enabled. Currently this upgrade policy is specific to CFEngine
Enterprise.

##### cfengine_internal_masterfiles_update (class)

Off by default.

This class enables masterfiles automatic update from a version control
repository. Currently this policy relies on tooling available in
CFEngine Enterprise.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to auto-deploy policies on the policy
server, it has no effect on clients. See
[Version Control and Configuration Policy][Best Practices#Version Control and Configuration Policy]
for details on how to use it.

**This may result in DATA LOSS.**

##### cfengine_internal_encrypt_transfers (class)

Off by default.

This class enables encryption during policy updates. If you are
running CFEngine versions 3.6 with `protocol => "2"` or `protocol =>
"latest"` this settings is unnecessary as all traffic will be
encapsulated inside of TLS. CFEngine Version 3.7 uses `protocol =>
"2"` by default.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to encrypt your policy transfers.

Note it has a duplicate in `def.cf`, see below. If they are not
synchronized, you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_purge_policies (class)

Off by default.

This class causes the update behavior to change from only copying
changed files down to performing a synchronization by purging files on
the client that do not exist on the server.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to delete any files in your
`$(sys.inputdir)` that are not in the policy server's masterfiles.

**This may result in DATA LOSS.**

Note it has a duplicate in `def.cf`, see below. If they are not
synchronized, you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_preserve_permissions (class)

Off by default.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to preserve the permissions of the policy
server's masterfiles when they are copied.

**This may result in FUNCTIONALITY LOSS if your scripts lose their
exec bits unexpectedly**

Note it has a duplicate in `def.cf`, see below. If they are not
synchronized, you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_disable_cf_promises_validated (class)

Off by default.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to have remote agents **always** scan all of
masterfiles for changes and update accordingly.

This is not recommended as it both removes a safety mechanism that checks for
policy to be valid before allowing clients to download updates, and the
increased load on the hub will affect scalability.

Consider using [time_based][Hard and Soft Classes], `select_class` or `dist` based
classes instead of any to retain some of the benefits.

##### enable_cfengine_enterprise_hub_ha (class)

Off by default.

This class enables the HA policy for CFEngine Enterprise hubs. This
class is not set by default.

#### cfe_internal_dc_workflow (bundle)

This bundle implements the auto-deployment of policies. See
[Version Control and Configuration Policy][Best Practices#Version Control and Configuration Policy]
and `cfengine_internal_masterfiles_update` below for details. This
policy is currently specific to CFEngine Enterprise.

#### cfe_internal_update_policy (bundle)

This bundle is defined in `cfe_internal/update/update_policy.cf`.
It updates the policy files themselves. Basically it's a
check step that looks at `$(sys.inputdir)/cf_promises_validated` and
compares it with the policy server's
`$(sys.masterdir)/cf_promises_validated`. Then there's the actual
copy, which happens only if the `cf_promises_validated` file was
updated in the check step. You can bypass this check and perform a
full scan by running `cf-agent -KIf update.cf -D validated_updates_ready`.

Implementation (warning: advanced usage):

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(masterfiles/cfe_internal/update/update_policy.cf, .*)%]

#### cfe_internal_update_bins (bundle)

This step does a self-update of CFEngine. See the Enterprise
documentation for details; this functionality is unsupported in
CFEngine Community.

#### cfe_internal_update_processes (bundle)

This step manages the running processes, ensuring `cf-execd` and
`cf-serverd` and `cf-monitord` are running and doing some other tasks.


### promises.cf

#### How it works ####

`promises.cf` is your main run file. Keep referring to your
installation's `promises.cf` as you read this.

`promises.cf` is the first file that `cf-agent` with no arguments will
try to look for. So whenever you see `cf-agent` with no flile
parameter, read it as "run my `promises.cf`".

It should contain all of the basic configuration
settings, including a list of other files to include. In normal
operation, it must also have a `bundlesequence`.

#### bundlesequence ####

The `bundlesequence` acts like the 'genetic makeup' of the
configuration. Edit the `bundlesequence` to add any bundles you have
defined, or are pre-defined. Consider using the `services_autorun`
facility so you don't have to edit this setting at all.

**BEWARE THAT ONLY VALID (KNOWN) BUNDLES CAN BE ADDED.**

By default, the inventory modules, then internal hub modules, then
Design Center sketches, then the autorun services, and finally
internal management bundles are in the `bundlesequence`.

In a large configuration, you might want to have a different
`bundlesequence` for different classes of host, so that you can build
a complete system like a check-list from different combinations of
building blocks. You can construct different lists by composing them
from other lists, or you can use methods promises as an alternative
for composing bundles for different classes. This is an advanced topic
and a risky area (if you get it wrong, your policies will not
validate) so make sure you test your changes carefully!

#### inventory_control (bundle)

The inventory policy was added in CFEngine version 3.6. Inventory
modules are desinged to define classes and variables based on the
inspected state of the system. These classes and variales can be
levereged when writing policy, and in CFEngine Enterprise they can be
reported on from Mission Portal. You can disable pieces of it
(inventory modules) or the whole thing if you wish.

##### disable_inventory (class)

This class is off by default (meaning the inventory is on by default).
Here's the master switch to disable all inventory modules.

##### disable_inventory_lsb (class)

LSB is the Linux Standard Base, see https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/en/LSB

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if the LSB
executable `/usr/bin/lsb_release` can be found. This inventory module
will populate inventory reports and variables for you with LSB
details. For details, see [LSB][The Policy Framework#LSB]

##### disable_inventory_dmidecode (class)

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if the
executable `/usr/sbin/dmidecode` can be found. This inventory module
will populate inventory reports and variables for you. For details,
see [DMI decoding][The Policy Framework#DMI decoding]

##### disable_inventory_LLDP (class)

LLDP is a protocol for Link Layer Discovery. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if the
executable `/usr/bin/lldpctl` can be found. This inventory module will
populate variables for you. For details, see [LLDP][The Policy Framework#LLDP]

##### disable_inventory_package_refresh (class)

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on). This
inventory module will populate the installed packages for you. On
CFEngine Enterprise, the available packages will also be populated.

##### disable_inventory_mtab (class)

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if
`/etc/mtab` exists. This inventory module will populate variables for
you based on the mounted filesystems. For details, see [mtab][The Policy Framework#mtab]

##### disable_inventory_fstab (class)

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if
`$(sys.fstab)` (usually `/etc/fstab` or `/etc/vfstab`) exists. This
inventory module will populate variables for you based on the defined
filesystems. For details, see [fstab][The Policy Framework#fstab]

##### disable_inventory_proc (class)

By default, this class is turned off (and the module is on) if `/proc`
is a directory. This inventory module will populate variables for you
from some of the contents of `/proc`. For details, see [procfs][The Policy Framework#procfs]

##### disable_inventory_cmdb (class)

By default, this class is turned on (and the module is off).

Turn this on (set to `any`) to allow each client to load a `me.json`
file from the server and load its contents. For details, see [CMDB][The Policy Framework#CMDB]

#### @(inventory.bundles) (bundle)

This bundle is defined as `bundle common inventory` in `promises.cf`.

Inventory bundles may vary between platform and other classes.

#### def (bundle)

This bundle is defined as `bundle common def` in `controls/def.cf`

`def` has some crucial settings used by the rest of CFEngine. It's
expected that users may edit it, but won't normally change the rest of
masterfiles except in `services` or if they *know* it's
necessary. This bundle should be configured in conjunction with
`update_def` as there are some settings that should be kept in sync
between the two policies.

As of CFEngine version 3.7 it is recommended that these setting
changes are specified in `def.json` to ease policy framework updates.

Keep referring to `def.cf` as you read this.

Implementation (warning: advanced usage):

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(masterfiles/controls/def.cf, .*)%]

##### augments_file (variable)

This variable defines the path to a JSON file used to "augment" the current definitions.

The `augments_file` is intended to ease policy framework upgrades by
providing a standard location for site specific settings to be
defined. Currently the augments file supports defining additional
inputs and classes as well as overriding variables matching `defvars`.

By default the `augments_file` is expected to exist in the root of
your policy. Should you want to deliver different augments files to
different clients, you may consider pointing this to a file
**outside** of the masterfiles tree that is downloaded by the
individual clients.

##### defvars (variable)

This variable defines the list of variables that are allowed to be
overridden by the `augments_file`.

##### augments (variable)

This variable contains the augments data as loaded from the
`augments_file`. By default this is limited to 100k. If your
`augments_file` is larger than 100k you will want to adjust this
limit.

Here is an example `augments_file`:

<pre>
[%CFEngine_include_markdown(masterfiles/example_def.json)%]
</pre>

##### domain (variable)

Set your `domain` to the right value. By default it's used for mail
and to deduce your file access ACLs.

##### mailto (variable)

This variable defines the email address that agent run output is sent to.

##### mailfrom (variable)

This variale defines the email address that emails containing agent
run output come from.

##### smtpserver (variable)

This variale defines the smtp server to use when sending agent emails.

##### acl (variable)

The `acl` is crucial. This is used by **every** host, not just the
policy server. Make sure you only allow hosts you want to allow.

##### trustkeysfrom (variable)

`trustkeysfrom` tells the policy server from which IPs it should accept
connections even if the host's key is unknown, trusting it at connect
time. This is only useful to be open during for bootstrapping these
hosts. As the comments say, empty it after your hosts have been
bootstrapped to avoid unpleasant surprises.

##### services_autorun (class)

Off by default.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to auto-load files in `services/autorun`
and run bundles found that are tagged `autorun`. Here's a simple
example of such a bundle in `services/autorun/hello.cf`:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(masterfiles/services/autorun/hello.cf, .*)%]

##### cfengine_internal_rotate_logs (class)

On by default.

Rotates CFEngine's own logs. Here is the `cfe_internal_log_rotation`
bundle implementation:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(masterfiles/cfe_internal/core/log_rotation.cf, .*bundle\s+agent\s+cfe_internal_log_rotation, \})%]

##### cfengine_internal_agent_email (class)

On by default.

This class enables agent email output from `cf-execd`.

##### cfengine_internal_encrypt_transfers (class)

Duplicate of the one in `update.cf`. They should be set in unison or
you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_purge_policies (class)

Duplicate of the one in `update.cf`. They should be set in unison or
you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_preserve_permissions (class)

Duplicate of the one in `update.cf`. They should be set in unison or
you may get unexpected behavior.

##### cfengine_internal_sudoers_editing_enable (class)

Off by default.  Only used on the CFEngine Enterprise hub.

Turn this on (set to `any`) to allow the hub to edit sudoers in order
for the Apache user to run passwordless sudo cf-runagent (part of
Mission Portal troubleshooting).

##### postgresql_maintenance_supported (class)

On by default only for CFEngine Enterprise Hubs.

This class enables maintaince routines for the database used in
CFEngine Enterprise.

##### postgresql_full_maintenance (class)

On by default only on Sundays at 2am when
postgresql_maintenance_supported is defined.

Set this class accordingly if you want to schedule database
maintenance operations at a different time.

##### postgresql_vacuum (class)

On by default at 2am when postgresql_maintenance_supported is defined
except for Sundays.

Set this class accordingly if you want to schedule database
maintenance operations at a different time.

##### enable_cfengine_enterprise_hub_ha (class)

Off by default.

Set this class when you want to enable the CFEngine Enterprise HA policies.

##### enable_cfe_internal_cleanup_agent_reports (class)

Off by default for core.
On by default for CFEngine Enteprise clients.

This class enables policy that cleans up report diffs when they exceed
`def.maxclient_history_size`.

#### @(cfengine_enterprise_hub_ha.classification_bundles) (bundle)

Bundles related to classification for CFEngine Enterprise HA.

#### cfsketch_run (bundle)

This bundle activates sketches deployed by the Design Center tooling.

#### services_autorun (bundle)

This bundle loads policies found in `services/autorun` that are
tagged for autorun.

See services_autorun

#### @(services_autorun.bundles) (bundle)

This activates bundles found by services_autorun.

#### cfe_internal_management (bundle)

This bundle activates policy related to CFEngine itself. For example
rotation of logs generated by the agent.

#### main (bundle)

This bundle is defined as `bundle agent main` in `services/main.cf`, it is the main entry into custom policy.

#### @(cfengine_enterprise_hub_ha.management_bundles) (bundle)

These bundles activate policy that manages HA in CFEngine Enterprise.

## inputs ##

In order to find bundles, CFEngine needs to know where to look. This
list defines what files are needed. Note there are several dynamic
entries here, coming from other bundles. CFEngine will keep evaluating
the `inputs` and `bundlesequence` until all the bundles are found and
resolved.

Make sure to add any of your own `services` files here if you don't
use the `services_autorun` facility, to ensure the bundles in them are
found.

## failsafe.cf

The `failsafe.cf` file ensures that your system can survive errors and
can upgrade gracefully to new versions even when mistakes are made.
It's literally a failsafe if `promises.cf` and `update.cf` should
fail.

This file is generated during the bootstrapping process, and should
normally never be changed. The only job of `failsafe.cf` is to execute
the update bundle in a “standalone” context should there be a syntax
error somewhere in the main set of promises. In this way, if a client
machine's policies are ever corrupted after downloading erroneous
policy from a server, that client will have a failsafe method for
downloading a corrected policy once it becomes available on the
server. Note that by “corrupted” and “erroneous” we typically mean
“broken via administrator error” - mistakes happen, and the
`failsafe.cf` file is CFEngine's way of being prepared for that
eventuality.

If you ever change `failsafe.cf` (or when you upgrade CFEngine), make
sure the old and the new CFEngine can successfully parse and execute
this file. If not, you risk losing control of your system (that is, if
CFEngine cannot successfully execute this policy file, it has no
failsafe/fallback mechanism for distributing new policy files).

Some general rules (but again, note you **can completely break your
CFEngine installation by editing `failsafe.cf`**):

* Upgrade the software first, then add new features to the configuration.
* Never use advanced features in the failsafe or update file.
* Avoid using library code (including any bodies from `stdlib.cf` or
the files it includes). Copy/paste any bodies you need using a unique
name that does not collide with a name in library (we recommend simply
adding the prefix “u_”). This may mean that you create duplicate
functionality, but that is okay in this case to ensure a 100%
functioning standalone update process). The promises which manage the
update process should not have any dependencies on any other files.

CFEngine will fail-over to the `failsafe.cf` configuration if it is
unable to read or parse the contents successfully. That means that any
syntax errors you introduce (or any new features you utilize in a
configuration) will cause a fail-over, because the parser will not be
able to interpret the policy. If the failover is due to the use of new
features, they will not parse until the software itself has been
updated (so we recommend that you always update CFEngine before
updating policy to use new features). If you accidentally cause a bad
(i.e., unparseable) policy to be distributed to client machines, the
`failsafe.cf` policy on those machines will run (and will eventually
download a working policy, once you fix it on the policy host).

## Further structure ##

* `cfe_internal`: internal CFEngine policies you shouldn't modify or
  you will get unexpected behavior

* `controls`: configuration of components, e.g. the `cf-agent` or
  `cf-serverd`, beyond what `def.cf` can offer. You'll see `3.6` which is for
  backwards compatibility and used only by `3.6` agents.  `3.7`+ agents will
  use the library files directly inside of this directory.

* `def.cf`: defaults you can and should configure, see above

* `inventory`: inventory modules (loaded before anything else to
  discover facts about the system) live here; see above

* `lib`: main library directory.  You'll see `3.5` and `3.6` and `3.7`
  under it.  These are the supported versions for masterfiles
  backwards compatibility.

* `promises.cf`: main policy, you will need to configure this, see above

* `services`: your site's policies go here

* `services_autorun`: see above

* `sketches`: Design Center installations use this; do not touch or
  you will get unexpected behavior

* `update` and `update.cf`: functionality for updating inputs and
  CFEngine itself, see above.  You only modify files under `update` if
  you know the impact of what you are doing or you may get unexpected
  behavior.

## cf_promises_validated

Several CFEngine components that read policy (e.g. `cf-agent`,
`cf-execd`, `cf-serverd`) run `cf-promises` to validate the syntax of
their input files before actually running the policy. To illustrate
this, if `cf-promises` runs every 5 minutes then there will be 12
checks occurring every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week -- a total
of 2016 possible validation checks. Each of those individual
validation sessions can take some number of seconds to perform
depending on the system, scale, circumstances and configuration.

Starting with CFEngine 3.1.2, the outcome of every run of
`cf-promises` was cached, which lets agents skip the validation of
input files that have not changed since the previous run.

Starting with CFEngine 3.6, outcome on both hosts and hubs is stored
in the file `$(sys.workdir)/masterfiles/cf_promises_validated`
(usually `sys.workdir` is `/var/cfengine`). The file can be created by
`cf-agent` after it has successfully verified the policy with
`cf-promises`. The file can also be created by a user with
`cf-promises -T DIRECTORY` which is useful for validating an entire
directory.

When the hash content of any file under `WORKDIR/inputs` changes, and
validates to be syntactically correct, then a timestamp in
`cf_promises_validated` is updated. If not, the run of `cf-promises`
is skipped and, at the same time, the cf-execd, cf-serverd and
cf-monitord daemons will not reload the policy unless
`cf_promises_validated` has an updated timestamp, which `cf-agent`
will normally take care of.

In the default installation, the masterfiles are populated
automatically on the policy server and you can even auto-deploy them
from a [version control system][Version Control].

You should configure the masterfiles as described above. Leaving them
at their default settings may expose your masterfiles or worse,
especially the cf-serverd ACL settings. If you are not sure of the
terms used below or what it all means, come back to this page after
you've learned about writing policy and the CFEngine syntax.

## CFEngine 3 Inventory Modules ##

The CFEngine 3 inventory modules are pieces of CFEngine policy that
are loaded and used by the `promises.cf` mechanism in order to
*inventory* the system.

CFEngine Enterprise has specific functionality to show and use
inventory data, but users of the Community Version can use them as
well locally on each host.

## How It Works ##

The inventory modules are called in `promises.cf`:

```
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => {
                        # Common bundle first (Best Practice)
                          inventory_control,
                          @(inventory.bundles),
                          ...
```

As you see, this calls the `inventory_control` bundle, and then each
bundle in the list `inventory.bundles`. That list is built in the
top-level common `inventory` bundle, which will load the right things
for some common cases. The `any.cf` inventory module is always loaded;
the rest are loaded if they are appropriate for the platform. For
instance, Debian systems will load `debian.cf` and `linux.cf` and
`lsb.cf` but may load others as needed.

The effect for users is that the right inventory modules will be
loaded and evaluated.

The `inventory_control` bundle lives in `def.cf` and defines what
inventory modules should be disabled. You can simply set
`disable_inventory` to avoid the whole system, or you can look for the
`disable_inventory_xyz` class to disable module `xyz`.

Any inventory module works the same way, by doing some discovery work
and then tagging its classes and variables with the `report` or
`inventory` tags.  For example:

```
  vars:
      "ports" slist => { @(mon.listening_ports) },
      meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=Ports listening" };
```

This defines a reported attribute "Ports listening" which contains a
list of strings representing the listening ports. More on this in a
second.

## Your Very Own Inventory Module ##

The good news is, writing an inventory module is incredibly easy.

They are just CFEngine bundles. You can see a simple one that collects
the listening ports in `any.cf`:

```
bundle agent cfe_autorun_inventory_listening_ports
# @brief Inventory the listening ports
#
# This bundle uses `mon.listening_ports` and is always enabled by
# default, as it runs instantly and has no side effects.
{
  vars:
      "ports" slist => { @(mon.listening_ports) },
      meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=Ports listening" };
}
```

Well, the slist copy is a CFEngine detail (we get the listening ports
from the monitoring daemon), so just assume that the data is correct.
What's important is the second line that starts with
[`meta`][Promise Types and Attributes#meta]. That
defines metadata for the promise that CFEngine will use to determine
that this data is indeed inventory data and should be reported to the
CFEngine Enterprise Hub.

That's it. Really. The comments are optional but nice to have. You
don't have to put your new bundle in a file under the `inventory`
directory, either. The variables and classes can be declared anywhere
as long as they have the right tags. So you can use the `services`
directory or whatever else makes sense to you.

## CFEngine Enterprise vs. Community ##

In CFEngine Enterprise, the reported data is aggregated in the hub and
reported across the whole host population.

In CFEngine Community, users can use the `classesmatching()` and
`variablesmatching()` functions to collect all the inventory variables
and classes and report them in other ways.

### Implementation Best Practice for CFEngine Enterprise ###

It is important that inventory variables and classes are continually
defined. Only inventory variables and classes defined during the last
reported run are available for use by the inventory reporting interface.

Inventory items that change frequently can create a burden on the
Enterprise reporting infrastructure. Generally, inventory attributes
should change infrequently.

If you wish to inventory attributes that frequently change or are expensive to
discover consider implementing a sample interval and caching mechanism.

## What Modules Are Available? ##

As soon as you use the `promises.cf` provided in the parent directory,
quite a few inventory modules will be enabled (if appropriate for your
system). Here's the list of modules and what they provide. Note they
are all enabled by code in `def.cf` as explained above.

### LSB ###

* lives in: `lsb.cf`
* applies to: LSB systems (most Linux distributions, basically)
