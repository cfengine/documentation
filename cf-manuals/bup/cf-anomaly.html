<h2 class="chapter">1 Monitoring with cfengine</h2>

<p>CFEngine is a system for self-sufficient maintenance and repair of
computer systems. Making cfengine as autonomous as possible, while at
the same time guiding it by strict policies, is a goal of the cfengine
project. To be autonomous, cfengine has to be able to observe the
state of a computer system and make decisions about it. In other
words, it has to be able to perform self-monitoring.

   <p>The idea that a configuration management system would perform
monitoring breaks with the philosophy of most software for IT
management. Traditionally, monitoring software has been completely
independent of change management software – but here we are rolling
them into one.

   <p>Let's try to explain. From an automation perspective, it makes no
sense to separate monitoring from change management. A repair system
needs to know when things are not working so that it can fix them. A
monitoring system alone is useless unless it can schedule a
repair. The process of maintenance is therefore much more efficient if
these two complementary aspects of system management are integrated.

   <p>In this document we shall explain how to make the most of the features
that cfengine offers you freely. In the future it will be possible to
buy additional software that allows you to derive deep insights into
system performance and behaviour from the cfengine software, but this
document is limited to what you can achieve with only the free tools.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Monitoring features</h3>

<p>Let's begin by thinking of the different ways in which cfengine can
monitor the state of a host. CFEngine is no ordinary monitoring
system. It does not simply generate warnings when certain values cross
certain thresholds.

     <ul>
<li>     Every policy rule that we code into cfengine leads to a check
being performed on the policy rule. If there is a problem it might
result in a warning, or in the problem being fixed automatically with
not even a message. 
<li>     Some checks are implicit. For example, when ever cfengine scans
through directories looking for files, it is on the look-out for
different kinds of files that could be dangerous. It will warn about
these, so in effect it is monitoring your filesystems. 
<li>The daemon cfenvd collects observations silently in the background of
your system and records the patterns of change that it sees taking
place. It learns these using simple machine-learning techniques
enabling cfengine to classify the state of your system in a number of
different ways as it interacts with the network. 
<li>Each time cfengine copies a file or executes a script, it measures the
time this operation takes, and so it implicitly measures the overall
performance of your system.

   </ul>

   <p>These are examples of the way in which cfengine collects information
about the operation of each computer on which it runs. The question
then is: how can we view this information and what is it good for?

<h3 class="section">1.2 Intrusion detection</h3>

<p>A lot of companies perform monitoring first and foremost for security
purposes. CFEngine does not care about the reason for monitoring, and
it does not assume any special interpretation if it detects changes or
events.

   <p>What is an intrusion or an attempted intrusion? This can be difficult
to define. If someone tries to login at root once? If someone tries to
login at root fifty times? Port scanning, SATAN or ISS scan? Someone
trying a known security hole? These things are quite uncertain. The
aim of an intrusion detection system is to detect events that can be
plausibly connected to break-ins, hopefully while they are still in
progress so that something can be done about them.

   <p>Intrusion detection is a special form of fault-diagnosis. Faults (in a
security system) are events that are not supposed to happen, but the
fact is that they do happen. As with all fault diagnosis systems,
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) give the wrong answers from time to
time. Because it is so difficult to define what intrusion actually
means in a generic sense intrusion detection systems tend to err on
the side of caution and report many false positives, i.e. false
alarms.

   <p>One way of doing fault diagnosis is to compare a system to a working
specification continuously. This is essentially what cfengine does
with systems.

   <p>There are many approaches to intrusion detection. These go well beyond
the scope of this document. Suffice it to say that cfengine is not
meant to be an intrusion detection system specifically. One thing
cfengine can detect however is change, and unexpected changes can
sometimes be interpreted as tell-tale signs of something unauthorized
happening. So there is scope for using cfengine as part of a
host-based intrusion system. CFEngine does not, however, try to
examine and diagnose network traffic.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Change Detection</h3>

<p>Change monitoring is about detecting when stored data, or other
measurable aspects of a computer system change. A change detection
system is not normally concerned with the reason for a change, but if
you are monitoring for change then we shall take it for granted
somehow that you are expecting to find changes that you didn't plan
for yourself.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Cryptographic checksums</h4>

<p>The most important bulk of information on a computer is its filesystem
data. Change detection for filesystems uses a technique made famous in
the program Tripwire, which collects a “snapshot" of the system in
the form of a database of file checksums (cryptographic hashes) and
permissions and rechecked the system against this database at regular
intervals. Tripwire examines files, and looks for change in their
contents or their attributes. This is a very simple (even simplistic)
view of change. If a legitimate change is made to the system, such a
system responds to this as a potential threat. Databases must then be
altered, or rebuilt.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Hashes or Digests</h4>

<p>A cryptographic hash (also called a digest) is an algorithm that reads
(digests) a file and computes a single number (the hash value) that is
based on the contents. If so much as a single bit in the file changes
then the value of the hash will change. You can compute hash values
manually, for example:

<pre class="smallexample">          host$ openssl md5 cfengine-2.2.4a.tar.gz
          MD5(cfengine-2.2.4a.tar.gz)= 6d2b31c4814354c65cbf780522ba6661
</pre>
   <p>There are several kinds of hash function. The most common ones are MD5
and SHA1. Recently both of the algorithms that create these hashes
have been superceded by the newer SHA2. CFEngine supports MD5 and SHA1
and it will support SHA2 as soon as the OpenSSL library supports an
interface to the new algorithm.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 Computing hashes</h4>

<p>CFEngine has adopted part of the Tripwire model, but with a few
provisoes. Tripwire assumes that all change is unauthorized and is
bad. CFEngine cannot reasonably take this viewpoint. CFEngine expects
systems to change dynamically, so it allows users to define a policy
for what changes are considered to be okay.

   <p>Integrity checks on files whose contents are supposed to be static are
a good way to detect tampering with the system, from whatever
source. Running MD5 or SHA1 checksums of files regularly provides us
with a way of determining even the smallest changes to file contents.

   <p>To use the checksum based change detection we first ask cfengine to
collect MD5 hash data for specified files. Here is an excerpt from a
cfengine configuration program that would check the /usr/local
filesystem for file changes. Note that it excludes files such as log
files that we therefore allow to change (log files are supposed to
change):

<pre class="smallexample">          files:
     
            /usr/local owner=root,bin,man
                       mode=o-w          # check permissions separately
                       r=inf
                       checksum=best     # this switches on change detection
                       action=warnall
                       ignore=logs
                       exclude=*.log
     
            # repeat for other files or directories
</pre>
   <p>The first time we run this, cfengine collects data and treats all
files as “unchanged”. It builds a database of the checksums. The
next time the rule is checked, cfagent recomputes the checksums and
compares the new values to the `reference' values stored in the
database. If no change has occurred, the two should match. If they
differ, then the file as changed and a warning is issued.

<pre class="smallexample">     
          cf:nexus: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          cf:nexus: SECURITY ALERT: Checksum (md5) for /etc/passwd changed!
          cf:nexus: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     
</pre>
   <p>This message is designed to be visible. If you do not want the
embracing rows of `!' characters, then this control directive turns
them off:

<pre class="smallexample">          control:
           Exclamation  = ( off )
</pre>
   <p>The next question to ask is: what happens if the change that was detected is actually okay (which is almost always the case). If you activate this option:

<pre class="smallexample">          control:
           ChecksumUpdates = ( on )
</pre>
   <p>Then, as soon as a change has been detected, the database is updated
and the message will not be repeated. If this is set to off, which is
the default, then warning messages will be printed each time the rule
is checked.

   <p>New files are automatically detected, as they are not in the
database. If you want to be notified when files are deleted, then set
the option

<pre class="smallexample">          control:
           ChecksumPurge = ( on )
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.4 Tamperproof data</h4>

<p>Message digests are supposed to be unbreakable, tamperproof
technologies, but of course everything can be broken by a sufficiently
determined attacker. Suppose someone wanted to edit a file and alter
the cfengine checksum database to cover their tracks. If they had
broken into your system, this is potentially easy to do. How can we
detect whether this has happened or not?

   <p>A simple solution to this problem is to use another checksum-based
operation to copy the database to a completely different host. By
using a copy operation based on a checksum value, we can also remotely
detect a change in the checksum database itself.

   <p>Consider the following code:

<pre class="smallexample">     
          # Neighbourhood watch
     
          control:
     
             allpeers = ( SelectPartitionNeighbours(/path/cfrun.hosts,#,random,4) )
     
          copy:
     
               /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db
     
                                 dest=/safekeep/chkdb_$(this)
                                 type=checksum
                                 server=$(allpeers)
                                 inform=true          # warn of copy
                                 backup=timestamp
                                 define=tampering
     
          alert:
     
           tampering::
     
                'Digest tampering detected on a peer'
     
</pre>
   <p>It works by building a list of neighbours for each host. The function
SelectPartitionNeighbours can be used for this. Using a file which
contains a list of all hosts running cfengine (e.g. the <samp><span class="file">cfrun.hosts</span></samp>
file), we create a list of hosts to copy databases from. Each host in
the network therefore takes on the responsibility to watch over its
neighbours.

   <p>The copy rule attempts to copy the database to some file in a
safekeeping directory. We label the destination file with <code>$(this)</code>
which becomes the name of the server from which the file was
collected. Finally, we backup any successful copies using a timestamp
to retain a complete record of all changes on the remote host. Each
time a change is detected, a copy will be kept of the old. The rule
contains triggers to issue alerts and warnings too just to make sure
the message will be heard.

   <p>In theory, all four neigbours should signal this change. If an attacker had detailed knowledge of the system, he or she might be able to subvert one or two of these before the change was detected, but it is unlikely that all four could be covered up. At any rate, this approach maximizes the chances of change detection.

   <p>Finally, in order to make this copy, you must, of course, grant access to the database in cfservd.conf.

<pre class="smallexample">     
          # cfservd.conf
          admit:
          any::
            /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db  mydomain.tld
</pre>
   <p>Let us now consider what happens if an attacker changes a file an
edits the checksum database. Each of the four hosts that has been
designated a neighbour will attempt to update their own copy of the
database. If the database has been tampered with, they will detect a
change in the md5 checksums of the remote copy versus the
original. The file will therefore be copied.

   <p>It is not a big problem that others have a copy of your checksum database. They cannot see the contents of your files from this. A potentially greater problem is that this configuration will unleash an avalanche of messages if a change is detected. This does make messages visible however.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Cfenvd, a learning agent</h3>

<p>CFEngine employs sophisticated machine learning techniques to learn
and compress information about the behaviour of each host into a small
round-robin database. Unlike monitors based on RRD-tool, cfengine
keeps data from several months' worth of measurements in only a week's
worth of space. It measures not only values but keeps statistical
profiles of values too.

   <p>Although cfenvd is not a compulsory part of cfengine, it is highly
recommended that you run this daemon. It requires few resources and
poses no vulnerability to the system. It will play an increasingly
important role in future developments. In cfengine 2.x, running cfenvd
means that additional classes are automatically evaluated based on how
the current state of the host compares to an average of all
corresponding times of week that have occurred over the past 6-8
weeks. The analysis is accomplished by the cfenvd daemon, which
continually updates a database of system averages and variances, which
characterize `normal' behaviour. Every 2.5 minutes, the state of the
system is examined and compared to the database values. Unlike a file
change, numerical values are not just different, they have
ordinality. The current state can be greater than or less than the
norm.

   <p>Simply being greater than the norm in a particular measurement is not
of itself very interesting. Random fluctuations in the patterns of
behaviour mean that the values are changing a lot all the time, but
these changes are not significant unless they become of the order of
magnitude of a standard deviation above the mean. CFEngine takes this
into account and classifies the current measured values on a scale of
standard deviations about the currently applicable mean. For instance,
it might set the following classes in cfagent:

     <ul>
<li>     RootProcs_low_dev2
<li>     netbiosssn_in_low_dev2
<li>smtp_out_high_anomalous
<li>www_in_high_dev3
<li>ftp_in_high_microanomaly
</ul>

   <p>The first of these tells us that the number of root processes is two
standard deviations below the average of past behaviour, which might
be fortuitous, or might signify a problem, such as a crashed
server. The WWW item tells us that the number of incoming connections
is three standard deviations above average. The smtp item tells us
that outgoing smtp connections are more than three standard deviations
above average, perhaps signifying a mail flood. The setting of these
classes is transparent to the user, but the additional information is
only visible to the privileged owner of the cfengine work-directory,
where the data are cached.

   <p>The term `microanomaly' is used to describe two standard deviations
above normal, when the delta of the change is less than the arbitray
value of 5. This is a small number, and anomalies of these kinds are
generally noise. Any deviation from the mean value can be called an
anomaly, but as we said above, anomalies do not necessarily have
anything to do with security, and definitely do not need to have
anything to do with system intrusions.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 Interpreting anomalies</h4>

<p>Simply specifying statistical number anomalies is not sufficient to
provide well-honed anomaly characteristics. CFEngine tries to organize
the information surrounding an anomaly first in terms of statistical
significance and then only later in terms of event
characteristics. There are too many events in which the numerical
values exceed thresholds determined by an arbitrary policy. Other
criteria are needed to pin down which anomalies are interesting and
which are not. As a second level of policy filtering, cfengine
provides a measure of the entropy of the source IP addresses of the
measured data. A low entropy value means that most of the events came
from only a few (or one) IP addresses. A high entropy value implies
that the events were spread over many IP sources. These conditions are
described by classes of the form:
     <ul>
<li>      entropy_www_in_high
<li> entropy_smtp_in_low
</ul>

   <p>Thus, for example, in the first case the class will be set if incoming
traffic at the peak event of the last data sample was spread evenly
over all the incoming addresses. Such an event indicates that the
resource usage is not due to a single source (e.g. an attacker from a
single location) but is evenly spread — perhaps just a coincidental
anomaly. In the second case, the low entropy smtp traffic must come
from one or two addresses and is more likely to be spam or an attack
of some kind. These classes can be combined with the specific anomaly
thresholds (see example below).

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 Entropy and its interpretation</h4>

<p>Entropy is a word that has entered the popular consciousness in
different ways. In physics entropy represents that amount if energy in
a system of fixed temperature that has become unavailable for turning
into useful work. It is commonly associated with the idea of
disorder. In computer science the term entropy is often used in
association with cryptographic keys and passwords. Bad passwords have
`insufficient entropy', which we understand to mean too little content
in some sense. All of these interpretations are correct but they can
be misleading. Entropy is actually a measure of how spread-out a
signal is. In the case of thermodynamics, it tells us how spread out
heat is. An engine or refrigerator needs some parts of the system to
be hot and some to be cold in order to drive work around the
system. If the entropy is too high, the temperature is spread out and
there is nothing to drive work. Disorder could mean that a beautiful
compact crystal dissolves into solution and is spread out evenly. In a
password, low entropy means that all of the symbols in the password
are close together in the alphabet. A high entropy password would show
significant variation.

   <p>CFEngine measures all kinds of different signals, from network
connection numbers to temperature perhaps. It does not measure the
entropy of these values specifically. However, for signals of network
origin, it measures the entropy of the addresses from which the
connections arrive.

   <p>If all connections come from a single address, the entropy is low
(0%). If each connection comes from a different address the entropy is
maximal (100%). This information can be useful when interpreting an
anomaly. A sudden increase in web connections from a single location
might be an attack (or a search-engine), while a sudden burst from
many different sources could be a coincidence (or a distributed
attack).

<p>The last-seen database is maintained automatically by cfagent and
cfservd. Each time one of these components successfully connects to
another host it records this information in its database. A plus sign
is used if cfagent instigated contact to cfservd another host
itself. A negative sign means that cfservd was contacted by a external
cfagent.

<h4 class="subsection">1.6.1 Intermittency times</h4>

<p>Intermittency times are recorded automatically by cfagent. They are
are complementary to the last-seen times above. Essentially cfengine
records the variability in last-seen times and calculates their
entropy. This statistic only means something if cfagent regularly
contacts a remote server. If contact is regular, then the entropy of
the last-seen times will be low, as the connection time will always be
the same. However, if a host connection is unreliable for whatever
reason, the entropy will increase. CFEngine translates these
computations into a percentage which is show in a FriendStatus(0)
alert.

<h3 class="section">1.8 Disk scans</h3>

<p>A measure that cfagent does not collect automatically is a scan of the
arrival process of disk changes. This is a highly disk intensive scan
so you should not perform this more than once per week. It is also
debatable whether it is worse running more often than once per
month. The distribution will not change signficantly and the
information provided does not change very often.

<pre class="smallexample">          disks:
            /filesystem
                scanarrivals=true
</pre>
   <p>The arrival process determines a best-guess inter-arrival time
distribution of files for a disk, which provides information about
user behaviour and possible performance bottlenecks. The
interpretation of this information is rather complicated and goes
beyond the scope of this document. If a scan has been made, cfenvgraph
will output the scan data along with other graph data.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Anomaly Detection</h2>

<p>There is no system available in the world today which can claim to
detect and classify the functioning state of a computer
system. CFEngine does not attempt to provide a “product” solution to
this problem; rather it incorporates a framework, based on the current
state of knowledge, for continuing research into this issue. In
version 2.x of cfengine, an extra daemon cfenvd is used to collect
statistical data about the recent history of each host (approximately
the past two months), and classify it in a way that can be utilized by
the cfengine agent.

   <p>The daemon may simply be started, with no arguments:

<pre class="smallexample">          cfenvd
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and it proceeds to collect data and work autonomously, without further
supervision. The cf-environment daemon is meant be trivial to use. The
current long-term data recorded by the daemon are: number of users,
number of root processes, number of non-root processes, percentage
disk full for root disk, number of incoming and outgoing sockets for
netbiosns, netbiosdgm, netbiosssn, irc, cfengine, nfsd, smtp, www,
ftp, ssh and telnet. These data have been studied previously, and
their behaviour is relatively well understood. In future versions, it
is expected to extend this repertoire, as more research is done.

   <p>The use of the daemon will not be reliable until about six to eight
weeks after installing and running it, since a suitable training
period is required to build up enough data for stable
characterization. The daemon automatically adapts to the changing
conditions, but has a built-in inertia which prevents anomalous
signals from being given too much credence. Persistent changes will
gradually change the `normal state' of the host over an interval of a
few weeks. Unlike some systems, cfengine's training period never
ends. It regards normal behaviour as a relative concept, which has
more to do with local stability than global constancy.

   <p>The final size of the database is approximately 2MB. Measurements are taken every five minutes (approximately). This interval is based on auto-correlation times measured for networked hosts in practice.

   <p>Cfenvd sets a number of classes in cfengine which describe the current
state of the host in relation to its recent history. The classes
describe whether a parameter is above or below its average value, and
how far from the average the current value is, in units of the
standard-deviation (see above). This information could be utilized to
arrange for particularly resource-intensive maintenance to be delayed
until the expected activity was low.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Using cfenvgraph</h3>

<p>The data revealed in the alerts above conceal the basic patterns that
underlie the detection of unusual signals. However, this information
can be extremely valuable to an analyst. It shows that patterns of
usage of a system over weeks. It shows stable patterns that can emerge
in the use of particular resources and it shows us when there are no
discernable patterns of usage.

   <p>Knowing the patterns of usage for a system can be important when
deciding whether a host can cope with the load placed upon it. When is
a client likely to receive good service, or slow service. The data can
have implications for Service Level Agreements (SLA). The data
underlying the learned patterns of behaviour can be shown using the
additional tools provided. The `cfenvgraph' command can use used to
dump a graph of averages for visual inspection of the normal state
database. The format of the file is

<pre class="smallexample">          t,y_1,y_2,y_3...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which can be viewed using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnuplot</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xgmr</span></samp>&rsquo; or other graphical
plotting program. This would allow the policy-maker to see what is
likely to be a good time for such work (say 06:00 hours), and then use
this time for the job, unless an anomalous load is detected. In 2009, the new cfengine
component <code>cfbrain</code> will be able to do this automatically.

   <p>The cfenvgraph command is used to extract data from the database used by the cfenvd environment daemon.

<pre class="smallexample">          cfenvgraph -f filename.db [-r -T -t -s -e]
</pre>
   <p>The command normally generates two files with format

<pre class="smallexample">          t, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...
</pre>
   <p>in a sub-directory of the current directory `cfenvgraphs-snapshot' (or cfenvgraphs-TIMESTAMP if `-T' is used).

   <p>The files are called
<pre class="smallexample">          cfenv-average
     
          cfenv-stddev
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and contain, respectively, the weighted average values of all the
recorded data and the square-root of the weighted variances with
respect to the averages. Data are weighted in such a way that older
values are gradually deprecated, becoming irrelevant after about two
months.

   <p>Normally the vertical scale of each graph is scaled so that each line
has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0, this allows all the
lines to be seen in maximum detail. However, this makes it difficult
to see the absolute values of the lines. With the `-n' option, no
scaling is performed and true values are plotted.

   <p>The complete data span a one-week period, and the daily rhythm of the
system may normally be viewed as a number of peaks, one per day.

   <p>The options are:

     <ul>
<li>`&ndash;help (-h)'
    List command options
<li>`&ndash;file (-f)'
    Specifiy file to plot. 
<li>`&ndash;titles (-t)'
    If the `-t' option is given, comments are generated at the start of the file which describe the columns. These are in a format understood by `vvgraph' as title/label data. 
<li>`&ndash;timestamps (-T)'
    If the `-T' option is given, the output filenames are time-stamped with the current time, in order to give a unique name. 
<li>&ndash;resolution (-r)'
    If the `-r' option is given then high resolution data are generated (five minute resolution), otherwise data are averaged over periods of one hour to generate simpler and smoother graphs. 
<li>`&ndash;separate (-s)'
    If the `-s' option is given, cfenvgraph generates separate files for each metric, in the format
</ul>

   <p>t,y,dy

   <p>where dy is the height of a vertical error-bar. This set of graphs combines the average with the standard-deviation. (Note that the error bars show the standard-deviation, and not the standard error of the mean i.e. stddev/sqrt(N)); the latter has no obvious meaning here. If `-e' is specified, then error bars are omitted.

   <p>`&ndash;no-error-bars (-e)'
    No error bars are plotted.

   <p>`&ndash;no-scaling (-n)'
    The graphs are not scaled, so that (min,max) is mapped onto the interval (0,1).

   <p>`&ndash;erasehistory (-E)'
    Wipes out the average and variance of the named observation categories from the learning database.

   <p>Note that the values printed for sockets always look higher than they
should for highly active services. This is because even those sockets
which are in <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> are counted. This is the correct way to
determine a normal state based on the recent past. It is a local
averaging performed by the kernel. If one counts only those
connections which are currently active, one gets a distorted view of
activity with a 5-minute sample rate. To measure more often than this
would place unacceptably high load on the system.

   <p>Graphs may be viewed in `vvgraph', `xmgr' (used in the pictures above)
or `gnuplot', or other graphical viewer. These graphs are not meant
for continuous viewing. The data are averages, not time-series.

<pre class="smallexample">     For example, with gnuplot
     
          host$ cfenvgraph -s
          host$ gnuplot
          gnuplot&gt; plot "www-in.cfenv" with errorbars
          gnuplot&gt; plot "www-in.cfenv" with lines
     
     The new version of xmgr is called xmgrace. It can be invoked as follows:
     
          host$ xmgrace -nxy cfenv-averages
          host$ xmgrace  rootprocs.cfenv
          host$ xmgrace -settype xydy  rootprocs.cfenv
          host$ xmgrace -settype xydy  rootprocs.cfenv -hardcopy -hdevice JPEG
</pre>
   <p>If you see the error "Strings are not allowed", it might be because
some "nan" values have come into the text file.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Fluctuation profiles</h3>

<p>Any model of fluctuating values is based on the idea that the changing
signal has a basic separation of signal and noise. The variability of
the signal is generally characterized by a probability distribution
which often peaks about the mean value. Some tools and many papers
assume that the distribution of fluctuations is Gaussian. This is
almost never the case in real computer systems.

   <p>To see what the distribution of fluctuations about the mean looks
like, you can plot the distibution files.

<h3 class="section">2.4 cfbrain</h3>

<p>An additional tool for purchase will be available within the next year
to extract the maximum use from the data learned by cfengine on
different hosts. Even distributed systems like cfengine can benefit
from exchanging and comparing data, just as the brain can add a whole
new level of cognition to the collation of data from autonomously
firing neurons.

   <p>Cfbrain is a project that will allow you to see beyond the simple
traces and anomaly messages that a system generates often
spuriously. It will go beyond the current state of the art and provide
analyses that will provide significant information about the state of
a data centre.

<h3 class="section">2.5 System Auditing</h3>

<p>If this variable is set to true then cfengine conducts extensive
auditing of its actions to a database in the work directory. When
rules are applied, their locations and policy version are recorded
also so that it is possible to see exactly which rule was applied and
when. It is assumed that the version is recorded as below:

<pre class="smallexample">     
         control:
           Auditing = true
     
</pre>
   <p>This variable acts as the global default behaviour and may be
overriden locally by audit=true/false attributes, where applicable.
