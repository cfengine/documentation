<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What are monitoring and reporting?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Monitoring is the sampling of system variables at regular intervals in
order to present an overview of actual changes taking place over time.
Monitoring data are often presented as extensive views of moving-line
time series. Monitoring has the ability to detect anomalous behaviour
by comparing past and present.

   <p>The term <i>reporting</i> is usually taken to mean the creation of short
summaries of specific system properties suitable for
management. System reports describe both promises about the system,
such as compliance, discovered changes and faults.

   <p>The challenge of both these activities is to compare <i>intended</i> or
<i>promised</i>, behaviour with the <i>actual</i> observed behaviour of the
system.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Should monitoring and configuration be separate?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
The traditional view of IT operations is that configuration,
monitoring and reporting a three different things that should not be
joined. Traditionally, all three have been independent centralized
processes. This view has emerged historically, but it has a major
problem.

   <p>Monitoring as an independent activity is inherently non-scalable.
When numbers of hosts grow beyond a few thousands, centralized
monitoring schemes fail to manage the information. Tying configuration
(and therefore repair) to monitoring at the host level is essential
for the effective management of large and distributed data facilities.
CFEngine foresaw this need in 1998, with its Computer Immunology
initiative, and continues to develop this strategy.

   <p>Cfengine's approach is to focus on scalability. The commercial editions
of CFEngine provide what meaningful information they can in a manner that
can be scaled to tens of thousands of machines.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is a CMDB?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

A Configuration Management Database (CMDB), sometimes called a Change
and Configuration Management Database (CCMDB), is a repository of
information about hardware and its expected state. CMDBs are basically
an outgrowth of <i>inventory databases</i>. They were embraced by many IT
companies as a plausible solution to configuration management, in the
absence of an alternative.

   <p>A CMDB records so-called <i>configuration items</i> (CI), which record
technical, ownership and proposed state data. A CMDB does not
generally record actual state &ndash; this is left for monitoring software.

   <p>The term CMDB originates from the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
framework, where it is given a prominent role in system planning and
verification. The CMDB is by definition a centralized repository.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">CMDB and CFEngine</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine deviates from the classical view of a CMDB to modernize the
concept for modern scaling requirements.  Configuration management
requires something more sophisticated than a database to describe
system patterns. The CMDB applies a <i>brute force</i> approach to
collection and searching of system data that does not scale well, and requires
large and expensive resources to manage.

   <p>CFEngine works with a highly compressed description of system
properties that is based on category classification rather than an
exhaustive inventory of computers. Being distributed in operation,
CFEngine can also enforce policy on state, without brute force imaging.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Decentralized data collection in CFEngine</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine is designed to scale to vast numbers of machines.  It does so
because it is fundamentally decentralized. Data about system state are
recorded <i>in situ</i> and are not transmitted over the network
directly. CFEngine summarizes and compresses system information before
making it available for central aggregation and analysis. This means
that high resolution data are available where they count, processing
is decentralized, and inexpensive summaries may be compared and mined
for correlations.

   <p>Cfengine's distributed architecture means that no data are lost if the
network fails temporarily. CFEngine uses the network <i>opportunistically</i>,
but it is not reliant on it for real-time operations.

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
If you have regular reporting needs, we recommend using our commercially supported
version of CFEngine (CFEngine Nova or above), as you will save considerable time
and resources in programming, and you will have access to the latest developments
through the software subscription.
</td></tr></table>

   <p>No promises made in CFEngine imply automatic aggregation of data to a central
location. In commercial cfengine versions, e.g. CFEngine Nova, an optimized
aggregation of standardized reports is provided, but the ultimate decision to
aggregate must be yours.

   <p>Monitoring and reporting capabilities in CFEngine depend on the
software version include:

     <ul>
<li><b>Community Edition:</b> Basic output to file or logs may be customized on a per-promise basis. Users can design their own log and report formats, but data processing and extraction from CFEngine's embedded databases must be scripted by the user.

     <li><b>Nova:</b> In addition to community features, Nova provides automated extraction of
data from CFEngine's self-learning agents, and the generation of a
standard set of reports in text, HTML or XML formats. Nova summarizes
distributed data and provides simple compression and aggregation of
these summaries. Finally summaries are tied into a knowledge map or
semantic index for browsing by IT operations. At this level CFEngine exceeds
other industry CMDB solutions for configuration.

     <li><b>Constellation:</b> In addition to Nova features, Constellation performs
additional data extraction from the collected reports. It analyses correlations
and provides reverse look up of system attributes based on searchable expressions.
At this level, CFEngine exceeds other industry CMDB solutions in both reporting
and configuration.

     <li><b>Galaxy:</b> In addition to Constellation features, Galaxy adds a number
of state of the art active probes that integrate network monitoring
with system node monitoring, offering a total and integrated overview
of networked system behaviour.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Cfengine's default behaviour is to report to the console (known as
standard output). It's default behaviour is to report nothing except
errors that are judged to be of a critical nature.

   <p>By using cfengine with the inform flag:
<pre class="verbatim"># cf-agent -I
# cf-agent --inform
</pre>
you can alter the default to report on action items (actual changes)
and warnings.

   <p>By using cfengine with the verbose flag:
<pre class="verbatim"># cf-agent -v
# cf-agent --verbose
</pre>
you can alter the default to report all of its thought-processes.
You should not interpret a message that only appears in cfengine's
verbose mode as an actual error, only as information that might be relevant
to decisions being made by the agent.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating custom reports &ndash; all versions</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine allows you to use <code>reports</code> promises to
make reports of your own. A simple example of this is shown below.

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "test" };
}

#

bundle agent test
{
reports:

  cfengine_3::

   "$(sys.date),This is a report"
     report_to_file => "/tmp/test_log";
}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">We can apply this idea to make more useful custom
reports.  In this example, the agent tests for certain software
package and creates a simple HTML file of existing software.

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "test" };
}

#

bundle agent test
{
vars:

 "software" slist => { "gpg", "zip", "rsync" };

classes:

 "no_report"        expression => fileexists("/tmp/report.html");
 "have_$(software)" expression => fileexists("/usr/bin/$(software)");

reports:

  no_report::

      "
      &lt;html>
      Name of this host is: $(sys.host)&lt;br>
      Type of this host is: $(sys.os)&lt;br>
      "

         report_to_file => "/tmp/report.html";

      #

      "
      Host has software $(software)&lt;br>
      "

        ifvarclass     => "have_$(software)",
        report_to_file => "/tmp/report.html";

      #

      "
      &lt;/html>
      "
         report_to_file => "/tmp/report.html";

}
</pre>

<p class="noindent">The outcome of this promise is a file called <samp><span class="file">/tmp/report.html</span></samp>
containing output like this:

<pre class="verbatim">      &lt;html>
      Name of this host is: atlas&lt;br>
      Type of this host is: linux&lt;br>

      Host has software gpg&lt;br>

      Host has software zip&lt;br>

      Host has software rsync&lt;br>

      &lt;/html>
</pre>

   <p>The mechanism shown above, can clearly be used to create a wide
variety of report formats, but it requires a lot of coding and
maintenance by the user.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Including data in reports</h3>

<p>CFEngine generates information internally that you might want to use
in reports. For example, the agent <code>cf-agent</code>
interfaces with the local light-weight monitoring
agent <code>cf-monitord</code> so that system state can be reported simply:

<pre class="verbatim">
body common control

{
bundlesequence  => { "report" };
}

###########################################################

bundle agent report

{
reports:

  linux::

   "/etc/passwd except $(const.n)"

     showstate => { "otherprocs", "rootprocs" };

}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">A corollary to this is that you can get cfengine to report
system anomalies.

<pre class="verbatim">reports:

 rootprocs_high_dev2::

   "RootProc anomaly high 2 dev on $(mon.host) at approx $(mon.env_time)

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating custom logs</h3>

<pre class="sp">

Logs can be attached to any promise. In this example, an executed shell command
logs a message to the standard output. CFEngine recognizes the <code>stdout</code>
filename for Standard Output, in the Unix/C standard manner.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent test
{
commands:

  "/tmp/myjob",

     action => logme("executor");

}

############################################

body action logme(x)
{
log_repaired => "stdout";
logstring => " -> Started the $(x) (success)";
}
</pre>

<p class="noindent">In this next example, a file creation promise
logs different outcomes (success or failure) to different
log files.

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "test" };
}

bundle agent test
{
vars:

  "software" slist => { "/root/xyz", "/tmp/xyz" };

files:

  "$(software)"

    create => "true",
     action => logme("$(software)");

}

#

body action logme(x)
{
log_kept => "/tmp/private_keptlog.log";
log_failed => "/tmp/private_faillog.log";
log_repaired => "/tmp/private_replog.log";
log_string => "$(sys.date) $(x) promise status";
}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">This generates three different logs with outputs in of the form:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">atlas$ more /tmp/private_keptlog.log

CFEngine interfaces with the system logging tools in different ways.
Syslog is the default log for Unix-like systems, while the event
logger is the default on Windows. You may choose to copy a fixed
level of cfengine's standard screen messaging to the system logger
on a per-promise basis.

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "one" };
}


bundle agent one
{
files:

  "/tmp/xyz"

       create => "true",
       action => log;
}

log_level => "inform";

In commercial versions of cfengine, you can extract data from the
system in more sophisticated ways from files or pipes, using Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions to match text. The <code>cf-monitord</code>
agent is responsible for processing measurement promises.

   <p>In this example, we count lines matching a pattern in a file.
You might want to scan a log for instances of a particular
message and trace this number over time.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle monitor watch
{
measurements:

   "/tmp/file"

         handle => "line_counter",
    stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "counter",
    match_value => scanlines("MYLINE.*"),
   history_type => "log";

}

#

body match_value scanlines(x)
{
select_line_matching => "^$(x)$";
}

</pre>

   <p>See the CFEngine Nova documentation for more possibilities of measurement
promises.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Change auditing - the all seeing eye</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Total auditing of a system is a surprisingly difficult thing to do,
and it is extremely resource intensive. The followers of an audit
trail are often paranoid by nature and are seldom satisfied with the
level of detail they find. However, the times we really need an audit
are rare, but the cost is ever present. The price of certainty is high.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Spend a moment considering this: if you want to describe every change
of state that happens on a computer, then you need to remember old
state and compare it to new state. Then you have to record the
differences. So you need more than the entire size of your computer's
normal resources to do this. Your storage efficiency will always be
less than 50% and your processing efficiency will be less than 50% on
every audited item. Is this worth the effort? Perhaps your resources
would be better spent keeping targeted backups and simply rebuilding
contaminated systems.
</td></tr></table>

   <p>Switch on auditing like this:

<pre class="verbatim">body agent control
{
auditing  => "true";
}

</pre>

   <p>If you decide to go for full auditing, CFEngine will not collect and
centralize the reports as they will be too large for this to be a
scalable operation. Still, you can view them in a web browser on the
local host, or copy them manually to a suitable location.

<div class="node">
<a name="Cheaper-options---tripwires"></a>

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Cheaper options - tripwires</h3>

<p>Doing a change detection scan is a convergent process, but it can
still detect changes and present the data in a compressed format
that is often more convenient than auditing. The result is less precise,
but there is a trade-off between precision and cost.

   <p>To make a change tripwire, you use a <samp><span class="file">files</span></samp> promise, something like this:

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence  => { "testbundle"  };
}
#

bundle agent testbundle

{
files:

  "/home/mark/tmp" -> "me"
       changes      => scan_files,
       depth_search => recurse("inf");
}

# library code ...

body changes scan_files
{
report_changes => "all";
update_hashes  => "true";
}

body depth_search recurse(d)
{
depth        => "$(d)";
}
</pre>

   <p>In CFEngine Nova, reports of the following form are generated when these promises
are kept by the agent:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">Change detected 	 File change
Sat Dec 5 18:27:44 2009  group for /tmp/testfile changed 100 -> 0
Sat Dec 5 18:27:44 2009  /tmp/testfile
Sat Dec 5 18:20:45 2009  /tmp/testfile
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">These reports are generated automatically in CFEngine Nova,
and are integrated into the web browsable knowledge map. Community
edition users have to extract the data and create these themselves.
