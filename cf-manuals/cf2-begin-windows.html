<h2 class="chapter">1 Declarative language</h2>

<p>CFEngine is a program meant to automate the job of system
administrators. Instead of writing adhoc custom scripts, cfengine
gives you the easy way of expressing the solution with simple and
straight forward declarative language. The declarative language allows
you to specify a policy for cfengine to implement. For example as a
policy, an administrator may want tmp directory to be emptied every
three days, may want the password file to always have the permission
644, ensure that apache is up all the time etc.  The policies such as
these and many more can easily be written for cfengine to implement.
For example a simple code such as

<pre class="smallexample">     files:
      c:\filename  mode=644 checksum=md5 action=fixall
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will enable cfengine to implement a file policy without any complex
script. CFEngine makes the policy implementation easy and simple.

<h3 class="section">1.1 CFEngine Components</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Cfagent is the most important component of cfengine software. It is the robot that interpret the user policy and implement it in a convergent manner.
<li>Cfexecd is the component that can schedule the execution of cfengine and inform the administrator about the results of the execution via email.
<li>Cfservd is the server daemon component. It is responsible only two operations, remote copy and execution. This means you don’t need cfservd to enable cfengine work. It is only becomes necessary when remote copy and execution are concerned.
<li>Cfenvd is used to collect statistical data about resource usage on each for anomaly detection.
<li>Cfkey is for public and private key generation.
<li>Cfshow  converts the cfengine database into ASCII  format and dump it in a file.
<li>Cfenvgraph formats the cfenvd database in a form that can be plotted
<li>Cfrun allows remote host to request the execution of cfengine.
</ul>

   <p>As beginners we will first concentrate on how to use cfagent to
implement simple policies since it is the most important component or
agent of the cfengine configuration management software. Don’t rush to
setup client/server configuration since it is not really needed to run
cfengine except for pulling operations. The CFEngine client/server
setup is only for update or copying or pulling of files from cfengine
server to cfengine client. The actual configuration management is done
by cfagent running on a host. By understanding how to run cfengine
configuration script on your local host is more than 60% of what is
required to implement cfengine network environment.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Installation</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Download the cfengine binary for the windows operating system from cfengine.com website into any directory (c:\user say).
<li> Unpack the zip file to any directory of your choice ( e.g c:\bin ) to obtain the cfengine binary
<li> All you need is <samp><span class="file">cygwin1.dll</span></samp>. You can obtain the
<samp><span class="file">cygwin1.dll</span></samp> by first installing cygwin on your windows system.
You then have to copy the cygwin1.dll from <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll</span></samp>
to the directory containing your cfengine binary files or put it in
<samp><span class="file">C:\Windows\System32</span></samp>. Uninstall cygwin from your system. You don't need
to install cygwin on the rest of your windows systems, you only have
to copy the cygwin1.dll and distribute it with your binary. Please
note that downloading cygwin1.dll directly may not work!!
<li> Run the cmd DOS command from "Run" or "Start" to the DOS prompt
<li>cd to your cfengine binary directory ( e.g cd bin )
<li>Run the command cfagent -vp, you should see the cfengine hard classes display. The command will also create the c:\var\cfengine directory including the other important cfengine subdirectories such as modules etc.
<li>Now you may copy your cfengine binary into <samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\bin</span></samp>
including your cygwin1.dll library. By default cfengine runs from
     <pre class="smallexample">             c:\var\cfengine directory.
</pre>
     <li> You should create the cfengine inputs directory in
<samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine</span></samp>. This is where cfengine reads its default
configuration files.
<li>Run the cfkey command to create the cfengine key pairs. This keys will be found in <samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\ppkeys</span></samp>
<li>To start using cfengine to manage your system, please read the online tutorial at cfengine.com or cfengine.org
<li> Note you can decide to use the cygdrive to specify a path to windows
file E.g <samp><span class="file">/cygdrive/c/myfile</span></samp> means <samp><span class="file">c:\myfile</span></samp> or you can
do it straight away in cfengine as <samp><span class="file">c:\myfile</span></samp>.
<li></ul>

<h3 class="section">1.3 The structure of cfengine declarative language</h3>

<p>The structure of cfengine declarative language is given below
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
      variable_1 = ( <var>value1 value2 ...</var> )
      variable_2 = ( <var>value1 value2 ...</var> )
     ...
      variable_n = ( <var>value1 value2 ...</var> )

      stanza1:

       [<var>condition or class</var>]::
        <var>target  attribute1=value1, attribue2=value2 ...</var>

      stanza2:

       [<var>condition or class</var>]::

         <var>target attribute1=value1, attribue2=value2 ...  </var>
</pre>
   <p>The control stanza is a special stanza where all the global variables
that will be used in the policy file are defined. The control could be
used to specify the order of execution, access control etc.

   <p><code>variable1</code> ... are the variable names, they can be
reserved or predefined variables or user defined variables. The values
of the variable are specified in the parenthesis. The values can be a
stanza or action type, a class or Boolean, a path or any appropriate
user defined value. The stanzas define the rule type or action type,
for example files rule type or action type, disk rule type or action
type etc.

   <p>Each stanza consists of optional condition for which the policy should
be implemented. The condition or class ( as called by cfengine ) must
be followed by double colon.  Within every stanza or rule type (action
type) we have target, attributes or options, values and
action. Usually, such attributes are defined by cfengine. However, one
can define their own attribute using the cfengine "defined"
keyword. For example the simple files stanza can have the following
attributes or options: <code>owner</code>, <code>mode</code>, <code>checksum</code>.

   <p>The values of the attributes are either predefined or user
defined. For example the value for the mode attribute <code>644</code> is user
defined but the value for checksum is <code>md5</code> which is predefined.  The
target defines the object to which cfengine will manage or operate on.
A target can be a file, a directory, a process etc.  action defines
the operation we want cfengine to perform on a given target. We also
have the target which specifies the object we want to apply the
policy.

   <p>In summary cfengine declarative language consist of

     <ul>
<li>special rule type called control
<li>varibles and values
<li>rule type, action type or stanza
<li>classes or conditions
<li>policies
</ul>

   <p>Example 1

   <p>We are going to test cfengine by simple files rule type example. We
will check if a file has mode <code>644</code> if not we change it to <code>000</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex1.conf
     control:
      actionsequence = ( files )
     files:
      /cygdrive/c:/cfengine/testfile.txt mode=000 action=fixall
     #end
</pre>
   <p>This policy specification allows cfengine to check if the target
(<samp><span class="file">testfile.txt</span></samp>) has permission <code>000</code>, if not cfengine will change
the permission to <code>000</code>. This check can be done every minute, hour
depending on what you want. CFEngine will automate the administrator's
job. The permission <code>000</code> means no one can read, write or execute the
file.

   <p>We will run cfagent to test if this policy will be implemented. We
first have to create the file testfile.txt and make it readable,
writable and executable by all. To do that right click the file and go
to properties -&gt; security and change the permissions.  Now create a
file called <samp><span class="file">cf_ex1.conf</span></samp> and type in the file policy in example 1.
Save the file in <samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\inputs</span></samp> folder. CFEngine by default
look for all the configurations files from <samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\inputs</span></samp>.

   <p>Type the following command for cfengine to implement the policy:
<pre class="smallexample">
     c:\var\cfengine\bin&gt;cfagent -vKf cf_ex1.conf

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The directory <samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\bin</span></samp> is where the cfengine agent is located and <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp>
is for verbose output, <samp><span class="option">-K</span></samp> is a command to force the
implementation of policy and <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> is used to specify the file
which contains the policy configuration. The policy configuration file
is found in <samp><span class="file">cf_ex1.conf</span></samp>. By default cfagent runs every 1 minute and if
that time is not elapsed since the last run the current configuration
will not be executed so <samp><span class="option">-K</span></samp> option is used to override this default
option.  In example 1 the actionsequence variable (directive or
command) has the value files. The value of the actionsequenece
variable is placed in parenthesis. There should be a space before and
after the variable value ( files ). The values of actionsequance
represent the rule type and the sequence of execution.

   <p>The sequence of
execution is simply first come first serve. E.g
<pre class="smallexample">     actionsequenece = ( files shellcommands )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means the files command must be executed before
the shellcommnds. The files stanza or rule type has the target
<samp><span class="file">testfiles.txt</span></samp> (the full path of the file should be specified)
and attributes or options of the files are mode and action and the
values are 000 and fixall respectively. The action is a special
attribute. It is used to specify operation to be performed or action
to be taken. The cygdrive is more reliable way of specifying cfengine
path. The path <samp><span class="file">/cygdrive/c/cfengine/testfile.txt</span></samp> will be
interpreted as <samp><span class="file">c:\cfengine\testfiles.txt</span></samp> in windows.

<!-- Example 2 -->
   <p>This example adds shell commands to example 1 and executes it from cfengine
<pre class="smallexample">
     #cf_ex2.conf
     control:
      actionsequence = ( files shellcommands )
      files:
      /cygdrive/c/cfengine/testfile.txt mode=644 action=fixall

     shellcommands:
       "/bin/echo ...second cfengine script ..."

</pre>
   <p>This example shows that cfengine configuration file may contain more
than one action type. The files action type just fix the file
permission of the testfile.txt and the shellcommands action type just
echoes or displays a message `second cfengine script'.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Debugging CFEngine</h3>

<p>This section helps us to understand some simple errors that we may encounter when creating cfengine configuration file. Whenever an error occurs in cfengine configuration files, cfengine will tell which line in the configuration contains the error. Using the –v option in cfagent execution helps us spot the error.

   <p>Example 2b

   <p>One of the common errors a beginner could make is the space around the actionsequence. In this example we try to remove the space around the action sequence value, files, and examine the response from cfengine.

<pre class="smallexample">
     #cf_ex2b.conf
     control:
      actionsequence = (files)  #no space around the files rule type
     files:
      /cygdrive/c/cfengine/testfile.txt mode=000 action=fixall
     #end
</pre>
   <p>Now run the following command
c:\var\cfengine\bin&gt;cfagent -vKf cf_ex1b.conf

   <p>The message you will see is:
/var/cfengine/inputs/cf_ex1b.conf:2: syntax error

   <p>This means you should examine line 2 of the cf_ex1b.conf file. Usually fengine does not suggest the kind of error. As a general rule it is good to always run cfengine with the verbose option. Also any time you have an error cfengine will be able to tell the line number in which the error occurred.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Declarative-language">Declarative language</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.5 Sequence vrs order</h3>

<p>The order in which you write the rule types in cfengine doesn't affect the sequence of execution. For example, example 2 can be rewritten as

<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex2a.conf
     control:
      actionsequence = ( files shellcommands )
     shellcommands:
       "/bin/echo ...second cfengine script ..."
     files:
      /cygdrive/c/cfengine/testfile.txt mode=644 action=fixall
     #end
</pre>
   <p>The results will be the same. The files rule type will be executed first followed by shellcommands since the actionsequence specifies so. So the sequence is specified by the actionsequence but the order of rules does not matter.

<h3 class="section">1.6 CFEngine Variables</h3>

<p>Variables allow us to store data in memory for processing. It enable a programmer to reference a certain memory location. Variables are declared in cfengine as follows:
name = ( value1, value2 ... )

   <p>The name can be any name that follows the general programming standard. The name can also be predefined name. Values are either given or user supplied. A variable can hold one or more data. Example 3 shows how to work with cfengine variables.

<pre class="smallexample">     Example 3
     #cf_ex3.conf
      control:
        actionsequence = ( shellcommands )
         hello = ( "hello cfengine " )  #hello variable
        shellcommands:
        "/bin/echo ..$(hello).."

</pre>
   <p>This code declares the hello variable and assigns the value "hello
cfengine". We then use shellcommands stanza to display the value of
the variables. The code $(hello) shows how cfengine references
variables. There are two ways of referencing cfengine variables. We
can reference a variable with parenthesis or curly bracket. For
example <code>$(hello)</code> can be rewritten as <code>${hello}</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">
     #cf_ex4.conf

      control:
        actionsequence = ( shellcommands )
         hello = ( "hello cfengine " )  #hello variable

      shellcommands:

        "/bin/echo ..${hello}.."

</pre>
   <p>Example 4 will produce the same result as example 3. The only
difference is that the parenthesis is changed to curly brace i.e.
<code>${hello}</code>.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Declarative-language">Declarative language</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.7 Input/output</h3>

<p>The values of a variable can be specified in the cfengine
configuration file or read from a file. Example 5 read data from a
file and stores it in a variable.

<pre class="smallexample">     Example 5
     #cf_ex5.conf
     control:
        actionsequence = ( shellcommands )
        data = ( ReadFile(/cygdrive/c/cfengine/data.txt,100) )  #reading from a file

      shellcommands:

        "/bin/echo ..$(data).."

</pre>
   <p>This example reads data from the file data.txt using the cfengine
ReadFile method. The output is stored in the variable data and the
result displayed by shellcommands. The <code>ReadFile()</code> method has two
parameters, the file name and the number of characters to be read.

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.8 Escape Sequence</h3>

<p>Special keys such as tab, newline etc can also be represented in
cfengine to format output. The following are the some of the escape
sequence.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to the carriage-return character.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dblquote</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to a double quote "
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dollar</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to `$'.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lf</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to a line-feed character
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to a newline character.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quote</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to a single quote '.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spc</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands simply to a single space. This can be used to place spaces in filenames etc.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tab</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Expands to a single tab character.
</dl>

   <p>Example 5a
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex5a.conf

     control:
        actionsequence = ( shellcommands )

     alerts:
        compiled_on_cygwin::

          "The car cost $(n) $(dollar)20,000 "

<h3 class="section">1.9 Selection or Classes</h3>

<p>Selection or classes allow a program to decide which code to
execute. In cfengine such commands are called classes. There are no if
statement in cfengine, only classes.  By default cfengine classifies
the system environment and used the results to make decisions. The
classes are Boolean with true or false values. We can see the default
or defined classes by running <code>cfagent -vp</code> command. My system has the
following define classes

<pre class="smallexample">     Defined Classes = ( 192_168_157 192_168_157_1 192_168_189 192_168_189_1 32_bit A

</pre>
   <p>This means I can use any of these values to make a decision. For example, this configuration

<pre class="smallexample">     files:
        August::
     /cygdrive/c/cfengine/testfile mode=644 action=fixall
</pre>
   <p>Means the file operation should be performed if the month is August. Each of the names in the Defined Classes can be used to write a conditional statement. Thus they are meant for decision making.

   <p>Users can also define their own classes which can also be used for decision making.

   <p>Example 6
This example displays the message "...cfengine classes in action.."  if the compiled_on_cygwin classes is found on your system. CFEngine will check if " compiled_on_cygwin" is part of the defined classes and displays the message accordingly.

<h3 class="section">1.10 Logical Operators and classes</h3>

<p>Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements or
classes. For example we can check if a our operating system is windows
or linux, the operating system is windows and the time is quarter pass
two and so on.

   <p>CFEngine has the following  logical operators:
     <ul>
<li>OR   &mdash; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo;
<li>AND  &mdash; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; (dot)
<li>Not  &mdash; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;
<li>Grouping &mdash;  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">( )</span></samp>&rsquo;
</ul>

<pre class="smallexample">     Example 8
     #cf_ex8.conf
     control:

     alerts:

       redhat.SuSE::

            "..cfengine classes found.."

</pre>
   <p>The output is nothing.

   <p>Example 8 shows the combination of two classes redhat and
SuSe. redhat.SuSe means if the distribution is redhat and suse display
the "cfengine classes found". Since a distribution cannot be both
redhat and suse or the two classes are not found in the defined
classes above nothing is displayed.

<pre class="smallexample">      #cf_ex9.conf

<h3 class="section">1.11 User Defined Classes</h3>

<p>It is possible to define your own class using the define keyword or classes rule or action type.

<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex11.conf   User define classes and sequence

     control:

     classes:

       Check = ( FileExists(/cygdrive/c/cfengine/cf.txt) )

     alerts:

        Check::
         "yes"

</pre>
   <p>This example defines the class <code>Check</code> using the classes rule type. The
method <code>FileExists()</code> is cfengine method which check whether or not a
file exists. The value of the class <code>Check</code> is true if the file cf.txt
is found <samp><span class="file">c:\cfengine</span></samp> in directory. The output of the policy will be
yes if the file is found.

<!-- Example 12 -->
   <p>Sometimes you may want cfengine to be aware of your user defined class
before it is used. We do this by using the AddInstallable method.

<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex12.conf

     control:
          #add class that might become define at run time
           AddInstallable = ( Check )
     classes:
       Check = ( FileExists(/cygdrive/c/cfengine/cf.txt) )

     alerts:
        Check::
         "yes"
</pre>
   <!-- Example 13 -->
   <p>User defined classes can be define at runtime.
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex13.conf
     #User define classes and sequence

     control:
         actionsequence = ( files )
         #add class that might become define at run time
         #the order of usage is not important
         AddInstallable  = ( RCheck )

     files:

       RCheck::   #RCheck is true

          /cygdrive/c/cfengine/test mode=700 action=fixall

     files:
           #define stores the outcome of execution
           #if mode is not 777 then change to 777 and set RCheck to true

           /cygdrive/c/cfengine/test1 mode=777 action=fixall define=RCheck

</pre>
   <p>This example uses the outcome of results in the second stanza (test1)
to fix the file permission for the <samp><span class="file">test</span></samp> file. The entire policy
reads like this, if the file permission for <samp><span class="file">test1</span></samp> file is not <code>777</code>
and the action is taken to change it to 777 then change the permission
of the <samp><span class="file">test</span></samp> file to <code>700</code>. The order is not important; the right
instruction will be executed.

<h3 class="section">1.13 List</h3>

<p>CFEngine list allows you to specify a list of items which can be
treated as a single variable. A list can be any set of names, file
names etc. The example 22 shows how to create a list.

<!-- Example 22 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
       alist = ( "one:two:three:four:five" )

     alerts:

      compiled_on_cygwin::

       " $(alist)"

</pre>
   <p>By default a list should be separated by colon. This can be changed using the Split option.

<!-- Example 23 -->
<pre class="smallexample">
     control:

        Split = ( , )
        alist = ( "one,two,three,four,five" )

     alerts:

      compiled_on_cygwin::
       " $(alist)"

</pre>
   <p>The <code>Split</code> method allows us to change the default colon to comma. The
power of a list is made clear when it is supplied as a parameter to a
method.

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
             Split = ( " " )
             mylist = ( "mark ricky bad-dude" )

     tidy:
             /cygdrive/c/$(mylist) pattern=*.cfsaved age=1

</pre>
   <p>In this example cfengine will iterate and substitute mylist with each
of the elements of in the list. It will then delete all .cfsaved file
which is a day old in each of the directory.

<h3 class="section">1.14 Recursion</h3>

<p>Recursion is used to iterate a directory of files and
subdirectories. The keyword for recursion is recurse. The value of
recurse is from <code>0</code> to <code>inf</code> (infinity). Where <code>0</code>
means stay in the current directory and infinity means everything in
the current directory including subdirectories.

<!-- Example 24 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
      actionsequence = ( files )

     files:
      /cygdrive/c/cfengineDoc mode=644 action=fixall recurse=inf

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example means change the mode of everything in the directory tree to 644.

<!-- Example 25 -->

     files:

       /cygdrive/c/cfengineDoc mode=644 action=fixall recurse=1

<h3 class="section">1.15 Methods</h3>

<p>A method is a set of instructions that achieve a specific task. It is
possible to perform a task using cfengine method. Methods in cfengine
is given by

<pre class="smallexample">     control

      MethodName = ( name )
      MethodParameters = ( p1 p2 ... )

       <var>method-body</var>

</pre>
   <p>The <code>MethodName</code> directive is use to specify the method name and the
<code>MethodParameters</code> specifies the parameters. The number of parameters
can zero or more. The method body is the usual cfengine policy
code. It is not different from what we know so far. We begin with a
simple method that displays a message.

<!-- Example 26 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex26.conf   User define classes and sequence
     control:

       MethodName = ( UserClass )

        #add class that might become define at run time
           AddInstallable = ( Check )

     classes:
       Check = ( FileExists(/cygdrive/c/cfengine/cf.txt) )

     alerts:
        Check::
         "Yes the cf exist"
       !Check::
          "No, cf does not exist"

</pre>
   <p>This method checks if the file cf exist and display a message. The
method is called <code>UserClass</code> and has no parameter. In cfengine it is
required that a method is placed in a special directory called
modules. The default location of this directory is
<samp><span class="file">c:\var\cfengine\modules</span></samp>. You should copy the <samp><span class="file">cf_ex26.conf</span></samp> file into
the modules folder. The next step is to create a method call
configuration file to make use of the method as in example 27.

<!-- Example 27 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex27.conf

     control:
      actionsequence = ( methods )

     methods:
       UserClass(void)
       action=cf_ex26.conf #include the method here
       returnvars=null  #no return value
       server=localhost #run the method on local machine

</pre>
   <p>The method call has the methods rule type. It is used to call the
method. Under methods rule type we call the method by name. Since our
method has no parameters we supply void as parameter entry. The action
directive now specifies which file contains the method. The <code>returnvars</code>
allows the return value to be store and reuse it later. Our method has
no return type so the value of return type is null. The server
attribute or option allows you to specify which host will run the
method. In this example the local host will run the method.

   <p>The next example shows how to use parameter in methods.

   <p>Example 28
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex28.conf   User define classes and sequence

     control:

       MethodName = ( UserClass )
       MethodParameters = ( filename )

        #add class that might become define at run time

           AddInstallable = ( Check )

     classes:
       Check = ( FileExists("/cygdrive/c/cfengine/$(filename)") )

     alerts:
        Check::
         "Yes the cf exists"
       !Check::
          "No, cf does not exists"

</pre>
   <p>This method performs the same task as example 26 however the file name
will not be fix but vary. The name will now be supplied at method
call. Example 29 is the method call for example 28. Note that the file
path is in double quote.

<!-- Example 29 -->
<pre class="smallexample">
     control:
      actionsequence = ( methods )

     methods:
      UserClass(cf)
      action=cf_ex28.conf
      returnvars=null
      server=localhost

</pre>
   <p>This example calls the method UserClass and supply the parameter
cf. The cf will replace the variable or parameter <samp><span class="file">filename</span></samp> so that
the file path will <samp><span class="file">c:\cfengine\cf</span></samp>. As usual the action option
specifies the file which contains the method. The method file must be
located in the modules directory. Note that the method call
configuration file should not be in the modules directory.

<h3 class="section">1.16 Method and return value</h3>

<p>A method can return a value which could be used for further
operation. In this case the return value will not be null. Example 30
illustrates how this could be done.

<!-- Example 30 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex30.conf   User define classes and sequence

     control:
       MethodName = ( ReturnName )
       MethodParameters = ( filename )

     classes:

        every = ( any )

     alerts:
       every::
        ReturnVariables("$(filename)")

</pre>
   <p>This method just accepts a file name and returns the name of the
file. The alerts rule type is needed to return the results. The method
call for example 30 is shown below.

<!-- Example 31 -->
<pre class="smallexample">
     control:
      actionsequence = ( methods )

     methods:
      ReturnName(cf)
      action=cf_ex30.conf
      returnvars=results
      server=localhost

     classes:
      every = ( any )

     alerts:
           every::
            "The file name is $(ReturnName.results)"

</pre>
   <p>Here the returnvars value is results. This means the file name being
returned by the method will be stored in the variable results. We then
use the alerts command to display the file name. The results variable
is accessed using the name of the method name.  Example 32 This
example shows how to use more than one parameters in cfengine method.

<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex32.conf User define classes and sequence

     control:
       actionsequence = ( editfiles )
       MethodName = ( EditMethod )
       MethodParameters = ( filename data )

     editfiles:

      {  /cygdrive/c/cfengine/$(filename)
         AppendIfNoSuchLine
          "$(data)"
      }

     classes:
        every = ( any )

     alerts:
       every::
        ReturnVariables("The file name is $(filename) and was editted with $(data)")

</pre>
   <p>Example 33 calls the method in example 32.

   <p>Example 33

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
      actionsequence = ( methods )
     methods:
      EditMethod(cf,"insert data here")

      server=localhost
     classes:

<h3 class="section">1.17 CFEngine Built in Methods</h3>

<p>CFEngine provides a number of built-in functions for evaluating
classes, based on file tests and perform other functions. Using these
built-in functions is quicker than calling the shell test function.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AccessedBefore(f1,f2)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if file 1 was accessed more recently than file 2 (UNIX atime)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ChangedBefore(f1,f2)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if file 1's attributes were changed in any way more recently than file 2's (UNIX ctime)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ClassMatch(regexp)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the quoted regular expression matches one of the currently defined classes. It is wise to place ClassMatch at the end of your parsing in order to capture as many of the user-defined classes as possible.
     <pre class="smallexample">                        classes:
                           userdef = ( ClassMatch(.*linux.*) )
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FileExists(file)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the named file object (file/directory or link) exists.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GroupExists(groupname|gid)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the groupname or group id is registered on the system.
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HostRange(basename,start-stop)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the current relative domain name begins with basename and ends with an integer between start and stop. Note well: matching is case insensitive (both hostname and basename are converted to all lower case for comparison.)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IsDefined(variable-id)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the named variable is defined. Note well: use the variable name, not its contents (that is, IsDefined(var), and not <code>IsDefined(${var})</code>)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IsDir(f)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the file f is a directory
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IsLink(f)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the file f is a symbolic link
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IsPlain(f)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the file f is a plain file
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IsNewerThan(f1,f2)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if file 2 was modified more recently than file 1 (UNIX mtime)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IPRange(address-range)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the current host lies within the specified IP range
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PrepModule(module,arg1 arg2...)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the named module exists and can be executed. The module is assumed to follow the standard programming interface for modules (see Writing plugin modules in tutorial). Unlike actionsequence modules, these modules are evaluated immediately on parsing. Note that the module should be specified relative to the authorized module directory.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Regcmp(regexp,string or list separated string)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>    True if the string matched the regular expression regexp.

        If this format is specified, ReadArray tries to interpret the file as a table of items separated with the separator character. Blank lines and comments (to end of line) are ignored. Items are keyed numerically starting from 1 to the maximum number in the file. The newline $(n) is always considered to be a separator, no matter what the current separator is.
    textkey
        If this format is specified, ReadArray tries to interpret the file as a list of lines of the form:

        If this format is specified, ReadArray tries to interpret the file as a table of items separated with the separator character. Blank lines and comments (to end of line) are ignored. Items are keyed numerically starting from 1 to the maximum number in the file. Any lines that do not contain the correct number of separators cause the function to fail without making any assignment.
    textkey
        If this format is specified, ReadArray tries to interpret the file as a list of lines of the form:
                         key1,key2,value1
                         key3,key4,value2
              This variable would then be references as $(table[key1][key2]).

Reads up to a maximum number of bytes from a TCP service. Can be used
to test whether certain services are responding to queries. It is
recommended that this be used primarily to check services running on
localhost. Bear in mind that this clause, executed on 100 hosts will
produce the effect of a distributed denial of service attack, so the
probe should be restricted to a single representative tester-host. For

<h3 class="section">1.18 List and methods</h3>

<p>What makes cfengine method powerful is the iteration. It is possible to iterate over a list using method. When a list is passed to a method cfengine will automatically iterate over the list.

   <p>Example 34
<pre class="smallexample">     #cf_ex34.conf

     control:

       MethodName = ( ReturnName )
       MethodParameters = ( filename )

     classes:
        every = ( any )

     alerts:
       every::
        ReturnVariables("$(filename)")
</pre>
   <p>We call the above method with example 35

   <p>Example 35

<pre class="smallexample">     control:

      actionsequence = ( methods )
      alist = ( one:two:three:four:five )

     methods:

      ReturnName($(alist))
      action=cf_ex24.conf
      returnvars=results
      server=localhost

     classes:

      every = ( any )
