### Enterprise Users can Manage Design Center Sketches 

## Getting Started Topics 

[Integrating the Mission Portal with git][Integrating Mission Portal with git]  The Design 
Center app requires access to a git repository in order to manage sketches. This section 
describes how to set up the git repository and how to connect the Mission Portal to the 
git repository. (The Design Center app is located on the Mission Portal console.) 
Instructions for testing the Design Center app and for reviewing git commit logs are also included. 

[Controlling Access to the Design Center UI][Controlling Access to the Design Center UI]  
This section describes how to give users access rights for making changes to the Design 
Center app. It describes how to allow or limit a Mission Portal user's ability to commit 
to the git repository and make changes to the hosts. All Mission Portal changes that users 
make through the Design Center app can be viewed in the git commit log.
