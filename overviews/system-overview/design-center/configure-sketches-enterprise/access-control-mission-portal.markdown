After you have set up the [integration between CFEngine Enterprise and git][Integrating Mission Portal with git],
you can grant or revoke access rights for making changes in the Design 
Center app to your users.

Note that use of the role-based access control (RBAC) for reporting in the Mission Portal
is not yet supported in conjunction with the Design Center app. For the time being, 
we recommend turning RBAC globally off in the Mission Portal settings when using the
Design Center app. Support for RBAC might be included in future versions.


## Roles

Two user roles impact users' abilities in the Design Center app:

* `cf_vcs`. Users that are members of the cf_vcs role can use the Design Center app
in the Mission Portal and commit to the git service that is configured in the settings. Conversely,
users they are not members of this role cannot access the Design Center app, not
even to list the available sketches.
* `cf_remoteagent`. This role allows users to invoke `cf-agent` on remote hosts and display the verbose
output from the agents. In the context of the Design Center app, this is used if a sketch activation
is non-compliant (red), and a user clicks a failed host followed by the "Verbose output" button.
Users can benefit from the Design Center app even though they are not members of the `cf_remoteagent` role.
Non-members cannot invoke remote `cf-agent` runs to get additional diagnostics data.

## Allowed changes

Users have access only to what the available sketches in the Design Center app offers. For example,
if the only available sketch in the app is one that controls file integrity monitoring (Security::file_integrity), 
users can only change files that CFEngine monitors. All users can see the same sketches,
and can activate on all hosts. There is not yet a concept of RBAC for the Design Center app.

The sketches that are available are controlled with the contents of `/var/cfengine/design-center` on the
Mission Portal server.

<!-- Please see (TODO: link to doc for creating new sketches) for more information. -->

Note however, that malicious users can potentially do damage to hosts even if you limit their
abilities. For example, if a user creates many activations of the Security::file_integrity sketch
for a large amount of directories, this will have a performance impact across the infrastructure.

To get complete control over what users do, changes can be reviewed before 
they are copied to `/var/cfengine/masterfiles` on the policy server. Refer 
to [Integrating Mission Portal with git][Integrating Mission Portal with git] for more information.


## Audit log

All changes that Mission Portal users make through the Design Center app become part of 
the git commit log. Each change in sketch activation corresponds to one
commit in git. In the git commit log, the git committer name and email is configured
in the Mission Portal settings. This allows for easily recognizing and parsing which commits
are made through the Mission Portal as opposed to other users of the git service.

In addition, the git author name and email is set to the user name and email address of the
user logged into the Mission Portal when the commit is made. This allows you to see exactly
which users are making which changes in the git commit log.
