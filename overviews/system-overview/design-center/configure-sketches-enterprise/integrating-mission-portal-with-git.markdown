CFEngine Enterprise 3.5 introduces integration with git repositories for 
managing CFEngine policy. In particular, the Design Center app requires access 
to a git repository in order to manage sketches.

These instructions describe how to set up a git repository that is hosted on the
Policy Server with the initial CFEngine `masterfiles` and how to configure
the CFEngine Mission Portal to use this repository. If you already have a git
service, ensure that you have a passphraseless key generated as shown in step 4 of [Set up the git service][Integrating Mission Portal with git#Set up the git service] 
and proceed to [Connect the Mission Portal to the git repository][Integrating Mission Portal with git#Connect the Mission Portal to the git repository].

As you follow these steps, refer to the diagram
in the [CFEngine Enterprise sketch flow][Sketch Flow in CFEngine Enterprise]. It provides 
a detailed look at the file structure and services that make up the Design Center app.

## Set up the git service

1. As `root` on the policy server, install a third-party repository that provides git.
   This is only required if git is not available in the default repositories, such as
   RHEL 5.

          root@policyserver # wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
          root@policyserver # rpm -Uvh epel-releases-5*.rpm

2. Install the `git` package.

          root@policyserver # yum install git

3. Create a `git` user and an `.ssh` directory.

          root@policyserver # adduser git
          root@policyserver # su - git
          git@policyserver $ mkdir ~/.ssh
          git@policyserver $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh

4. Generate a passphraseless ssh key to be used by the Misson Portal.
         
          root@policyserver $ /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -C 'Mission Portal' -N '' -f mission_portal_id_rsa

   Note: This key is only intended for use by the Mission Portal. 

5. Authorize the Mission Portal's key for the `git` user by appending the public
   key to the git user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

          root@policyserver $ grep "$(cat mission_portal_id_rsa.pub)" /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys || \
          cat mission_portal_id_rsa.pub >> /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys; \
          chown git:git /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys; \
          chmod 700 /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys

6. Test that you can log in as the `git` user by using the generated
   passphraseless ssh key.

        root@policyserver $ ssh -i mission_portal_id_rsa git@localhost
        git@policyserver $

   Once the authorization is tested successfully, move the keypair
   to a secure storage location. You might want to authorize additional keys
   for users to interface with the repository directly. Only the Mission
   Portal key needs to be passphraseless. Your git server can have additional
   features like the ability to make a specific key read-only. See your git
   provider's documentation for more information.

7. As the `git` user on the policy server, create the `masterfiles` repository.

        git@policyserver $ git init --bare masterfiles.git
            Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/masterfiles.git/

## Initialize the git repository

1. As the git user, create a clone of the `masterfiles` repository.

        git@policyserver $ git clone ~/masterfiles.git ~/masterfiles
        Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/masterfiles/.git/
        warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
        git@policyserver $ cd masterfiles

2. Copy and push the initial masterfiles.

        git@policyserver $ cp -R /var/cfengine/share/NovaBase/* .
        git@policyserver $ git add -A
        git@policyserver $ git commit -m "initial masterfiles"
        git@policyserver $ git push origin master

3. Ensure that cf_promises_validated is not included in your repository.

        git@policyserver $ git rm -f cf_promises_validated
        git@policyserver $ echo cf_promises_validated > .gitignore
        git@policyserver $ git add .gitignore
        git@policyserver $ git commit -m "Exclude cf_promises_validated from repository"
        git@policyserver $ git push origin master

## Update masterfiles from git

Although a git repository is set up, nothing will change on the
CFEngine hosts until the policy from git is pulled into
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles` on the policy server. This can be done by CFEngine
itself every time `cf-agent` runs on the policy server, or by utilizing a cron
job or similar facilities.

It is not a requirement to set up automatic pull from the git service; however, 
no actions will be taken by CFEngine on the end hosts, nor will any
reports come back, until the policy from git is copied into
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles` on your policy server.

The following steps show how to configure `cf-agent` on the policy server to
pull from git every time it runs (by default every 5 minutes).

1. On a working copy of your git repository, add the promise to update from git.
   Create `update/update_from_repository.cf` with the following content.

    ```cf3
        bundle agent update_from_repository
        {
        commands:

        am_policy_hub::

          "/usr/bin/git fetch --all"
            contain => u_no_output;

          "/usr/bin/git reset --hard origin/master"   # change to your branch
            contain => u_no_output;
        }

        body contain u_no_output
        {
          no_output => "true";
          chdir => "/var/cfengine/masterfiles";
        }
    ```

2. Modify the `update.cf` file: Add `update_from_repository.cf` to `inputs` and
add `update_from_repository` to `bundlesequence` in the body common control.

    `user@workstation $ git diff update.cf`:

    ```diff
    diff --git a/update.cf b/update.cf
    index 9c6c298..ab5cc1f 100755

    ```

3. Commit the two above changes to the git service.

        user@workstation $ git add update.cf update/update_from_repository.cf
        user@workstation $ git commit -m "automatically fetch masterfiles from git"
        user@workstation $ git push origin master         # change to your branch

4. Log in to the policy server as root and make sure CFEngine is not running.

        root@policy_server # /etc/init.d/cfengine3 stop
        Shutting down cf-execd:                                    [  OK  ]
        Shutting down cf-serverd:                                  [  OK  ]
        Shutting down cf-monitord:                                 [  OK  ]

5. Move the current masterfiles out of the way.

        root@policy_server # mv /var/cfengine/masterfiles/ /var/cfengine/masterfiles.orig

6. Clone your git repository into /var/cfengine/masterfiles. 

   If you are hosting the git repository on the policy server itself, you can
     clone using its full path.

        root@policy_server # git clone /home/git/masterfiles.git /var/cfengine/masterfiles

7. Make sure that the policy has valid syntax. `cf-promises` should not give output.

        root@policy_server # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-promises -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/update.cf

8. Restart CFEngine.

        root@policy_server # /etc/init.d/cfengine3 start


## Connect the Mission Portal to the git repository

1. Log in to the Mission Portal as an administrator (e.g. the `admin` user).
2. Navigate to *Settings* -> *Version control repository*.
3. Input the settings from the git service that you are using or configured.
   The values for the fields based on the previous instructions for setting up
   a local git server are as follows:

        Git server url: `git@localhost:masterfiles.git` 
        Git branch: `master`
        Committer email `git@localhost.localdomain`
        Committer name `CFEngine Mission Portal`
        Git private key `mission_portal_id_rsa.pub` as generated in step 5 of 
        [Set up the git service][Integrating Mission Portal with git#Set up the
        git service] (You will need to copy the private key to your workstation
        so that it can be accessed via the file selection.

4. Click save settings and make sure it reports success.

## Test the Design Center app

1. Log in to the Mission Portal as an administrator (e.g. the `admin` user).
2. Click the `Design Center` app at the left.
3. View the listing of some sketches that are available out of the box.
4. Click the `Packages::packages_removed` sketch.
5. Fill out the fields as shown by the example below, and click `Show Hosts` and then `Activate`.
 ![Test activation in Mission Portal](mission-portal-test-activation.png)
6. Type "My test activation" into the commit message box and commit.

### Review the change history from the git commit log

Our test sketch (created above) is now committed to the git repository. Go to a clone of the
git repository, pull from the git service, and see that the commit is there:

1. Fetch your latest commit.

        $ git fetch upstream

2. Rebase, and adjust to the branch you are using (master in this example).

        $ git rebase upstream/master

3. Note that the git author (name and email) is set to the user of the Mission Portal,
while the git committer (name and email) comes from the Mission Portal settings, under Version Control Repository.

        $ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ae, %cn, %ce : %s"
                4190ca5 - test, test@localhost.com, Mission Portal, missionportal@cfengine.com : My test activation

We have now confirmed that the Mission Portal is able to commit to our
git service, and that author information is kept.


### Filter commits by Mission Portal and users

If the Mission Portal is just one out of several users of your git service, you can easily filter
which commits came from the Mission Portal, and which users of the Mission Portal authored the commit.


#### Show all commits made through the Mission Portal

In order to see only commits that are made by users of the Mission Portal, filter on the committer name.
Note that this needs to match what you have configured as the committer name in the settings,
under Version Control Repository (we are using 'Mission Portal' in the example below).

We can also see the user name of the Mission Portal user by printing the author name.

````
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %an: %s" --committer='Mission Portal'
0ac4ae0 bob: Setting up dev environment. Ticket #123.
5ffc4d1 bob: Configuring postgres on test environment. Ticket #124.
4190ca5 bob: My test activation
0ac4ae0 tom: remove failed activation
5ffc4d1 tom: print echo example
dc9518d rachel: Rolling out Apache, Phase 2
3cfaf93 rachel: Rolling out Apache, Phase 1
````

#### Show commits by a Mission Portal user

If you are only interested in seeing the commits by a particular user of the
Mission Portal, you can filter on the author name as well ('bob' in the example below).

````
 $ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --committer='Mission Portal' --author='bob'
0ac4ae0 Setting up dev environment. Ticket #123.
5ffc4d1 Configuring postgres on test environment. Ticket #124.
4190ca5 My test activation
````

## End to end wait time

If we set up the CFEngine policy server to pull automatically from git and CFEngine runs
every 5 minutes everywhere (the default), the maximum time elapsed from committing to git
until reports are collected is **15 minutes**:

*  0 minutes: commit to git (e.g. from the Design Center GUI).
*  5 minutes: the policy server has updated `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`.
* 10 minutes: all hosts have downloaded and run the policy.
* 15 minutes: `cf-hub` on the database server has collected reports from all hosts.


## Access control and security

Go to [Controlling Access to the Design Center UI][Controlling Access to the Design Center UI]
to learn how to allow or limit the Mission Portal user's ability
to commit to the git repository and make changes to the hosts.
