There are a number of components in CFEngine, with each component performing a 
unique function: components responsible for implementing promises, components 
responsible for organizing large networks of agents, and other components 
responsible for providing the infrastructure of CFEngine.

These components form the basis of automation with CFEngine. They are 
independent software agents running on the various systems that make up your 
infrastructure. They communicate with one  another as shown in the following 
figure, using a protocol that allows each  host to distribute promises, act 
upon them, and report status to a central server.

## The Working Directory

The CFEngine application is fully contained within the `/var/cfengine` 
directory tree.

### Core Components

The CFEngine software components exist in `/var/cfengine/bin`.

* [`cf-agent`][cf-agent]

This is the instigator of change. Everything that happens on a client machine 
happens because of cf-agent. The agent is the part of CFEngine that 
manipulates system resources.

`cf-agent`'s only contact with the network is via remote copy requests. It 
does not and cannot grant any access to a system from the network. It is only 
able request access to files from the server component.

* [`cf-serverd`][cf-serverd]

By starting this daemon you can set up a line of communication between hosts.
The server is able to share files and receive requests to execute existing 
policy on an individual machine. It is not possible to send (push) new 
information to CFEngine from outside.

This daemon authenticates requests from the network and processes them 
according to rules specified in the
[server control body][cf-serverd#Control Promises] and server bundles 
containing [access promises][access].

* [`cf-execd`][cf-execd]

This is a scheduling daemon for `cf-agent`, similar to cron.
It executes and collects the output of `cf-agent` and
e-mails any output to the configured e-mail address.

* [`cf-promises`][cf-promises]

The promise verifier and compiler. This is used to run a "pre-check" of 
configuration promises before attempting to execute.

* [`cf-runagent`][cf-runagent]

A helper program which can be used to run `cf-agent` on a number of remote 
hosts. It cannot be used to tell `cf-agent` what to do, it can only ask 
`cf-serverd` on the remote host to run the `cf-agent` with its existing 
policy. It can thus be used to trigger an immediate deployment of new policy, 
if their existing policy includes that they check for updates.

Privileges can be granted to users to provide a kind of Role Based Access 
Control (RBAC) to certain parts of the existing policy.

### Policy files

* `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`

Policy repository which grants access to local or bootstrapped CFEngine 
clients when they need to update their policies. Policies obtained from 
`/var/cfengine/masterfiles` are then cached in `/var/cfengine/inputs` for 
local policy execution. The `cf-agent` executable does not execute policies 
directly from this repository.

* `/var/cfengine/inputs`

Cached policy repository on each CFEngine client. When `cf-agent` is 
invoked by `cf-execd`, it reads only from this directory.

* `/var/cfengine/modules`

Location of scripts used in `commands` promises.

### Output Directories

* `/var/cfengine/outputs`

Directory where `cf-agent` creates its output files. The outputs directory is 
a record of spooled run-reports. These are often mailed to the administrator 
by `cf-execd`, or can be copied to another central location and viewed in an 
alternative browser. However, not all hosts have an email capability or are 
online, so the reports are kept here.

* `/var/cfengine/reports`

Directory used to store reports. Reports are not tidied automatically, so you 
should delete these files after a time to avoid a build up.

* `/var/cfengine/ppkeys`

Directory used to store encrypted public/private keys for CFEngine
client/server network communications.

* `/var/cfengine/state`

State data such as current process identifiers of running processes, 
persistent classes and other cached data.

* `/var/cfengine/lastseen`

Log data for incoming and outgoing connections.

## Logs and Records

On hosts, CFEngine writes numerous logs and records to its private workspace. 

[CFEngine Enterprise][Enterprise Report API] provides solutions 
for centralization and network-wide reporting at an arbitrary scale.

### Embedded Databases

Their file extensions will vary based on which library is used to
implement them: either Tokyo Cabinet (`.tcdb`) or Quick Database Manager
(`.qdbm`).

* `cf_lastseen.tcdb`

A database of hosts that last contacted this host, or were contacted by
this host, and includes the times at which they were last observed.   

* `cf_classes.tcdb`

A database of classes that have been defined on the current host,
including their relative frequencies, scaled like a probability.   

* `cf_variables.tcdb`

A database of variables (name and value) that were defined on the
current host during the last run, including relative frequencies.

* `checksum_digests.tcdb`

The database of hash values used in CFEngine's change management
functions.   

* `performance.tcdb`

A database of last, average and deviation times of jobs recorded by
`cf-agent`. Most promises take an immeasurably short time to check, but
longer tasks such as command execution and file copying are measured by
default. Other checks can be instrumented by setting a
`measurement_class` in the `action` body of a promise.   

* `stats.tcdb`

A database of external file attributes for change management
functionality.   

* `state/cf_lock.tcdb`

A database of active and inactive locks and their expiry times. Deleting
this database will reset all lock protections in CFEngine.   

* `state/history.tcdb`

CFEngine Enterprise maintains this long-term trend database.   

* `state/cf_observations.tcdb`

This database contains the current state of the observational history of
the host as recorded by `cf-monitord`.   

* `state/promise_compliance.tcdb`

CFEngine Enterprise database of individual promise
compliance history. The database is approximate because promise
references can change as policy is edited. It quickly approaches
accuracy as a policy goes unchanged for more than a day.   

* `state/cf_state.tcdb`

A database of persistent classes active on this current host.   

* `state/nova_measures.tcdb`

CFEngine Enterprise database of custom measurements.

* `state/nova_static.tcdb`

CFEngine Enterprise database of static system discovery data.

### Text logs

* `promise_summary.log`

A time-stamped log of the percentage fraction of promises kept after
each run.   

* `cf3.HOSTNAME.runlog`

A time-stamped log of when each lock was released. This shows the last
time each individual promise was verified.   

* `cfagent.HOSTNAME.log`

Although ambiguously named (for historical reasons) this log contains
the current list of setuid/setgid programs observed on the system.
CFEngine warns about new additions to this list. This log has been
deprecated.   

* `cf_value.log`

A time stamped log of the business value estimated from the execution of
the automation system.   

* `cf_notkept.log`

In CFEngine Enterprise, a list of promises, with handles and comments, that 
were not kept.

* `cf_repaired.log`

In CFEngine Enterprise, a list of promises, with handles and comments, that were repaired.

* `reports/*`

CFEngine Enterprise uses this directory as a default place for outputting
reports.

* `state/cf_procs`
A cache of the process table. This is useful for `measurement` promises about processes.

* `state/cf_rootprocs`
A cache of the process table of processes owned by the root user. This is useful for `measurement` promises about processes.

* `state/cf_otherprocs`
A cache of the process table for processes not owned by the root user. This is useful for `measurement` promises about processes.

* `state/file_changes.log`

A time-stamped log of which files have experienced content changes since
the last observation, as determined by the hashing algorithms in
CFEngine.   

* `state/*_measure.log`

CFEngine Enterprise maintains user-defined logs based on specifically
promised observations of the system.

* `state/env_data`

This file contains a list of currently discovered classes and variable
values that characterize the anomaly alert environment. They are altered
by the monitor daemon.   

* `/var/logs/cfengine-install.log`

This file contains logs related to the CFEngine package installation.

### Process Information

The CFEngine components keep their current process identifier number in
`pid files' in the work directory. For example:

    cf-execd.pid
    cf-serverd.pid
