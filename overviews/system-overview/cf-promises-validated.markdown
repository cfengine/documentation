Several CFEngine components that read policy (e.g. `cf-agent`, `cf-execd`, `cf-serverd`) run `cf-promises` to validate the syntax of their input files before actually running the policy. To illustrate this, if `cf-promises` runs every 5 minutes then there will be 12 checks occurring every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week -- a total of 2016 possible validation checks. Each of those individual validation sessions can take some number of seconds to perform depending on the system, scale, circumstances and configuration.

Starting with CFEngine 3.1.2, the outcome of every run of `cf-promises` was cached, which lets agents skip the validation of input files that have not changed since the previous run. 

Starting with CFEngine 3.6.0 outcome on both hosts and hubs is stored in the file `$(sys.workdir)/masterfiles/cf_promises_validated` (usually `sys.workdir` is `/var/cfengine`). The file can be created by `cf-agent` after it has successfully verified the policy with `cf-promises`. The file can also be created by a user with `cf-promises -T DIRECTORY` which is useful for validating an entire directory.

When the hash content of any file under `WORKDIR/inputs` changes, and validates to be syntactically correct, then a timestamp in `cf_promises_validated` is updated. If not, the run of `cf-promises` is skipped and, at the same time, the cf-execd, cf-serverd and cf-monitord daemons will not reload the `policy` unless `cf_promises_validated` has an updated timestamp, which `cf-agent` will normally take care of.
