CFEngine operates autonomously in a network, under your guidance. While 
CFEngine supports anything from 1 servers to 100,000+ servers, the essence of 
any CFEngine deployment is the same.

CFEngine supports networks of any size, from a handful of nodes to
hundreds of thousands of computers. It is built to scale. If your site
is very large (thousands or of servers) you should spend some time
discussing your requirements with the CFEngine experts. They will know
how to tune promises and configurations to your environment as scale
requires you to have more infrastructure, and a potentially more
complicated configuration.

But no matter the scale, the essence of any CFEngine deployment is the same.
