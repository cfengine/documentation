If you are experiencing problems with logging into the Mission Portal or don't 
see up-to-date data, check the following points:

* Make sure that the daemon processes are running

`ps -e` should list processes 'cf-hub', 'httpd' and 'mongod'

If that is not the case, run:

    $ rm -f /var/cfengine/state/mongod.lock
    $ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-execd -Ov > cfout.log

* check the CFEngine output

If the processes are still not running after this, check the generated output file for:

    [timestamp] verbose: Comment 'Start CFE httpd process if not exist'

and

    [timestamp] verbose: Comment 'Check for mongod process'

The lines around those comments might give an indication why the respective 
processes failed to start.

* Check apache and mongo logs

If problems remain in spite of running processes, or if the processes 
terminated immediately after a successful start, check the logs in:

    /var/cfengine/httpd/logs/*
    /var/log/mongo.log

These should provide details about why the processes refused to start, shut 
down or continue to deny access.
