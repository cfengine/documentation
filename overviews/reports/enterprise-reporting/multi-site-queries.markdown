A CFEngine site can be viewed as an independent group of machines/devices that are 
managed and maintained by CFEngine. Distribution and execution of policies and 
report collection happen within a site.

Policy distribution is handled by the policy server, `cf-serverd`. CFEngine 
agents (`cf-agent`) pull the policies made available by the policy server 
and apply them to the clients. CFEngine's report collector (`cf-hub`) gathers 
reports from all the available agents and stores them into a centralized 
reporting database. These reports can then be accessed through the CFEngine 
Mission Portal or the CFEngine Enterprise Report API. 

An 
organization can maintain multiple sites. Users can querying multiple sites with 
a single command. SQL queries can be executed on different sites 
transparently with multi-site query tool, thus making it is easier for users 
to obtain a high level overview of their systems. The same queries that are 
used to find answers about a particular site can also be used on multiple sites. 

For example, when the following is executed with the multi-query tool, it returns the 
total number of hosts that are bootstrapped to all sites:

    SELECT count(*) as total_count FROM Hosts;

The following diagram shows an overview of how multi-query reporting tool 
works.

### Definition

* Aggregator  
A python script `multidb-query.py` that distributes the queries to available 
CFEngine database servers and then aggregates the result.

* Aggregated database interface  
Combines all the sqlite3 result files and presents an interface for the 
aggregator to send the aggregation query. This is implemented internally with 
the use of sqlite's ATTACH DATABASE command.

* Replica detection  
The [Enterprise API][Enterprise API] returns the available replica set to 
redirect the query.

* sqlite3 export  
A part of reporting engine that converts the result-set into a sqlite3 db file 
for transfer to the aggregator.

### Installation

Ubuntu 12.04 (precise):

```
    $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
    $ sudo gdebi cfengine-multihub_1.0.0_all.deb (installs dependencies too)
    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip (might need to upgrade requests see Troubleshooting)
    $ sudo pip install requests --upgrade
```

### Common use cases

**Use Case 1:** Simple query (SELECT * FROM Hosts;)

```
    ./multidb-query.py -u"admin" -p"admin" -H'[["192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.4"],["192.168.0.5"],["192.168.0.6"]]' -q"SELECT * FROM Hosts;" -s"http" -c
    HostKey									HostName	IPAddress	ReportTimeStamp	FirstReportTimeStamp
    20ecdd8da8aacd89fe1317dbfd399cf69a011bcdd7919fac753a11f9db46ceb7	192.168.0.6	192.168.0.6	1370294146	1370282434
    0821cf714637e2446df0d445fd4a25b587df3f00bd6eb408e6a90f0bf67342e8	master		192.168.0.2	1370294127	1370281540
    5252d3cdbcdcd61bedc0b4e49f890a54a75693848ab50f8e1276d426a5d235d5	192.168.0.5	192.168.0.5	1370294140	1370282119
```

**Use Case 2:** Joins between multiple tables
	
Find all RedHat hosts:

```
    ./multidb-query.py -u"admin" -p"admin" -s"http" -c -H'[["192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.4"],["192.168.0.5"],["192.168.0.6"]]' -q"SELECT h.HostName AS hname, v.VariableValue AS vvalue FROM Hosts AS h INNER JOIN Variables AS v ON h.HostKey=v.HostKey where v.VariableName=\"flavour\" AND v.VariableValue REGEXP(\"redhat.*\");"	
    hname		vvalue
    192.168.0.6	redhat_5
    master		redhat_5
    192.168.0.5	redhat_5	
```

**Important:** Create aliases for column names and table names during JOIN queries. `SELECT *` on a JOIN 
query may result in errors because 
different tables can have columns with the same name. For example, HostKey is common in 
most tables. The Enterprise API (server) will not be able to create 
intermediate (results) database for transfer to the client.

**Use Case 3:** Count and Aggregation queries

Count the number of RedHat hosts:

```bash
    ./multidb-query.py -u"admin" -p"admin" -s"http" -c -H'[["192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.4"],["192.168.0.5"],["192.168.0.6"]]' -q"SELECT count(h.HostName) as redhat_hosts_count FROM Hosts AS h INNER JOIN Variables AS v ON h.HostKey=v.HostKey where v.VariableName=\"flavour\" AND v.VariableValue REGEXP(\"redhat.*\");"
    redhat_hosts_count
    3
```

**Use Case 4:** Sorting and Grouping

```
    ./multidb-query.py -u"admin" -p"admin" -H'[["192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.4"],["192.168.0.5"],["192.168.0.6"]]' -q"SELECT * FROM Variables ORDER BY VariableType LIMIT 4;" -s"http" -c
    HostKey								 NameSpace	Bundle		VariableName	VariableValue	VariableType
    20ecdd8da8aacd89fe1317dbfd399cf69a011bcdd7919fac753a11f9db46ceb7 sys	workdir	/var/cfengine	string
    20ecdd8da8aacd89fe1317dbfd399cf69a011bcdd7919fac753a11f9db46ceb7 sys	winsysdir	/dev/null	string
    20ecdd8da8aacd89fe1317dbfd399cf69a011bcdd7919fac753a11f9db46ceb7 sys	winprogdir86	/dev/null	string
    20ecdd8da8aacd89fe1317dbfd399cf69a011bcdd7919fac753a11f9db46ceb7 sys	winprogdir	/dev/null	string
```

### Limitations

Embedded SQL is not supported at the moment so you will not be able to do the following: 

```
    SELECT count(SELECT DISTINCT HostName From Hosts) from Hosts
```

### Recommendations and best practices

**Always use aliases for operations involving multiple tables.** 

Instead of this:

    SELECT Hosts.HostKey, PromiseLogs.HostKey FROM Hosts INNER JOIN 
        PromiseLogs ON Hosts.HostKey=PromiseLogs.HostKey;

use:

    SELECT Hosts.HostKey AS hkey, PromiseLogs.HostKey AS pkey FROM Hosts INNER 
        JOIN PromiseLogs ON hkey=pkey;

or even better:

    SELECT h.HostKey AS hkey, p.HostKey AS pkey FROM Hosts AS h INNER JOIN 
        PromiseLogs AS p ON hkey=pkey;

**Always use aliases for functions:**

    SELECT count(*) as column_count from Hosts

**Use LIMIT with ORDER BY whenever possible.**

Instead of this:

    SELECT Hosts.HostName AS Name FROM Hosts
        LIMIT 10

Use:

    SELECT Hosts.HostName AS Name FROM Hosts
        ORDER BY Hosts.ReportTimeStampLIMIT 10


### Troubleshooting

#### Error in status query

Always check the syslog in the corresponding CFEngine database server if the error output at the 
multi-site client is not sufficient. The IP address for the machine where the 
error occurred is prefixed with every error message. There are `--inform(-i)` 
and `--debug(-d)` options available that provide detail about the individual 
steps on the operation.

    ERROR:root:[10.100.100.130] Error exporting results to sqlite3 database file
    ERROR:root:Error in status query

**Something went wrong while executing the SQL query at the server.**
Check the syslog in [10.100.100.130]. If you see something like the following, 
it means that the Enterprise API received the exact same query:

    Error executing query - message: database is locked, sql: "CREATE TABLE results

**Same query from multiple requests at the same time is not supported currently.** 
A simple example would be trying to query the same CFEngine database server in a multi-site query:

    $ python multidb-query.py -u admin -p admin
        -H '[["10.100.100.130"], ["10.100.100.130"]]' -s"http"
        -q"SELECT HostName, Count(1) as HostCount FROM Hosts GROUP BY HostName LIMIT 100".

#### No hubs available to query

    ERROR:root:Error: No hubs available to query, cannot continue

If one of the hubs in the query cannot be contacted, the query cannot continue 
by default. To override this behavior, use the `-e, --continue-on-error` 
option.

If you still get this error with `-e`, then a network connectivity error probably exists.

#### No hubs available to query for a group

    WARNING:root:No hubs available to query for group: [u'10.100.100.10', u'10.100.100.11']

This warning is displayed when run with the `-e, --continue-on-error` option.
This means that none of the members in the replica set could be contacted.

#### Invalid response code

This is the HTTP response code that is received from the server. Currently only 200 
(success) is regarded as valid.

Check to see if the CFEngine Enterprise API is running and responding correctly on the site.

    curl admin:admin http://10.100.100.130/api

#### Connection Error

Connection errors can be caused due to various reasons. A stack trace is 
printed in case of a connection error.

Multi-Site reporting uses "HTTPS" by default. If you are hosting the CFEngine 
Enterprise API under a different URL Scheme name, you will get

    ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='10.100.100.177', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api (Caused by <class 'socket.error'>: [Errno 111] Connection refused)
    INFO 2013-05-13 15:23:15,168 [10.100.100.177] Hub NOT available for report query

You can specify a different scheme name with the option:

    -s URL_SCHEME_NAME, --url-scheme-name URL_SCHEME_NAME
                            Url scheme name. eg. https(default), http


    $ ./multidb-query.py -u"admin" -p"admin"
      -H'[["10.100.100.177"],["10.100.100.179"]]' -q"SELECT * from hosts;"
      -s"http" -i

#### Invalid input IP addresses list

If you do not supply a proper JSON array with correctly formatted IP addresses, you might get an error such as the following:

    ERROR 2013-05-29 14:50:02,158 Invalid hub IP addresses list. No JSON object could be decoded
or,

    ERROR 2013-05-29 14:55:40,419 Invalid hub IP addresses list. Expecting , delimiter: line 1 column 8 (char 8)
  
Make sure that the IP address list supplied is properly formatted.

The following is incorrect. A proper JSON array must be enclosed in outer square 
brackets `[]`:  

    -H"['10.100.100.130'],['10.100.100.131']"
    
The following is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the outer double quotes and the inner single quotes:

    -H"[['10.100.100.130'],['10.100.100.131']]"
    
The following is the correct format:

    -H'[["10.100.100.130"],["10.100.100.131"]]'


To supply replica set groups:  

    -H'[["10.100.100.130", "10.100.100.132", "10.100.100.133"],["10.100.100.131", "10.100.100.135"]]'

#### Outdated python-requests version

The API for python-requests has been changed v1.0.0 (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/HISTORY.rst)  

Sample errors:

	AttributeError: 'Response' object has no attribute 'json'
	AttributeError: 'Response' object has no attribute 'text'

To upgrade python-requests:

```bash
sudo pip install requests --upgrade
```
