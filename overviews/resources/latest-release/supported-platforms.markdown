CFEngine Enterprise has [Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) Recognized status](http://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=48493) from IBM.
This means that CFEngine Enterprise has been technically verified by IBM
to be installed in and manage VIOS environments.

## Hub/Host compatibility

We strongly recommend to install identical versions on all hosts and servers 
in your system.

A server running CFEngine Enterprise 3.6 can serve policy to and collect data 
from hosts running the following versions of CFEngine:

* 3.5.x
* 3.0.x
* 2.2.x

Some data will not be available from older hosts, and the policy you serve 
needs to take into account hosts with different versions.

## Additional platforms

CFEngine is known to run on a wide range of other platforms. As long as the 
platform is POSIX compliant and has a C compiler toolchain that fully implements 
the C99 standard, we are happy to work with you to make CFEngine available.
Please [contact our sales team][contact us] for details.

Note that availability of the current version of CFEngine on these platforms 
does not imply availability of future versions of CFEngine.
