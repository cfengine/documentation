The CFEngine Enterprise API allows HTTP clients to interact with the Policy server (hub) 
of a CFEngine Enterprise installation. 

In CFEngine Enterprise 3.5 and later, [Multi-Site Query][Multi-Site Queries] 
support allows centralized collection of data from multiple CFEngine 
Enterprise installations and sites.

The Enterprise API is a REST API, but a central part of interacting with the 
API involves using SQL. With the simplicity of REST, the flexibility of 
SQL and the scalability through Multi-Site queries, users can craft custom 
reports about systems of arbitrary scale, mining a wealth of data residing 
on globally distributed CFEngine Database Servers.

Refer to the [Enterprise API Reference][Enterprise API Reference] section for the SQL schema 
and URI resources.
