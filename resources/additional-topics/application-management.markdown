## What is application management?

Application management concerns the deployment and updating of software, as well
as customization of for actual use, in other words all the activities required
to make an application ready for use. Initially, software installation packages
must be deployed on host machines, however, we frequently encounter the need to
update software due to security flaws, bugs or new features.

It is generally unwise to let every application update itself automatically to
the newest version from the internet; we want to decide which version gets
installed and also make sure that the load on the network does not impair
performance during mass-updates. Equally important is making sure certain
applications are not present, especially when they are known to have security
issues.

Using CFEngine, you can verify that the software is in a promised state and is
properly customized for use.

## How can CFEngine help?


CFEngine assists with application management in a number of ways. Following the
BDMA lifecycle, we note:

* Build

    CFEngine can be used to automate the build of packaged software releases
    using standardized or custom package formats.

* Deploy

    CFEngine can distribute and install packaged software on any kind of
    platform.

* Manage

    CFEngine can start, stop, restart, monitor, and upgrade, and customize
    software applications.

* Audit

    CFEngine can monitor and report on packages and patches installed on systems
    and their versions and status.

## Package management


Application management is simple today on most operating systems due to the
introduction ofpackage systems.

All major operating systems now have some sort of package management system,
e.g. RPM for Linux, and MSI for Windows. However, their capabilities and methods
vary greatly. Moreover, the packages they need to install have to be made
available to the hosts that need them and the package manager has to be executed
at the right time and place. This is where CFEngine assists.

Some package managers support online automatic access of online repositories and
can download data from the network. Others have to have packages copied to local
storage first. CFEngine can work with both types of system to integrate software
management.

* CFEngine communicates with the system using its own standards to utilize the
  approach suitable for that software system.

* Custom software repositories can be made, and CFEngine's agents can perform
  this distribution by collecting software packages to local storage and then
  installing from there.

When software packages are available on local storage, CFEngine can check
whether they are already installed, and if so, which version and architecture
are installed. This, in turn, can be verified against the policy for the
software — should it indeed be installed, updated or removed?

Using the CFEngine standard library, agents know how to talk to the native
package manager to query information and get the system into the desired state.

CFEngine can edit configuration files in real time to ensure that applications
are customized to local needs at all times.

## Enterprise software reporting

In commercial releases of CFEngine, the state of software installation is
reported centrally and is easily accessible through the Knowledge Map.

Commercial editions of CFEngine also support querying Windows machines for
installed MSI packages and thus allows for easy software deployment in
heterogeneous Unix and Windows environments.

## Integrated software installation

CFEngine gives complete freedom to users, so there are many ways to design a
system that achieves a desired software end-state. Consider the following
example setup which ensures that one particular application is up to date on all
hosts. The procedure below is very similar to the way that commercial CFEngine
editions update.

Rather than using an OS-specific package repository, like yum, we create a
universal approach using CFEngine's distribution and installation promises.

We first look at the example on an RPM system, then we show the modifications
required to handle Windows instead. The examples use body parts from the
standard library.

### Distributing software packages to client hosts

To begin with, we promise that the relevant software packages will be locally
available to the agents from software servers, i.e. we promise that a local copy
of all deployed software packages will exist in the directory /software_repo on
local storage. The copy will be collected and compared against a directory
called /master_software_repo on host server.example.org in this example.

We say that this approach is data-driven because, by placing software package
data in the central repository, client hosts update automatically, as they
promise to subscribe to the data.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:

    "/software_repo"

        comment => "Copy app1 updates from software server",
       copy_from => remote_cp("/master_software_repo/app1/$(sys.flavour)",
                               "server.example.org"),
    depth_search => recurse("inf"),
         classes => if_repaired("newpkg_app1");
}
```

When the agent copies a relevant software package from the software server
(sys.flavour is the local operating system), the class newpkg_app1 will get
defined. This class can act as a trigger to stop the application, update it, and
start it again.

### Stopping and restarting an application for update

On some operating systems, software cannot be updated while it is running.
CFEngine can promise to enure that a program is stopped before update:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
processes:

 newpkg_app1::

  "app1" signals => { "term", "kill" };
}
```

CFEngine normal ordering, ensures that processes promises are always run prior
to packages promises, so the application will be stopped before updated. Next we
promise the version of the software we want to install. In this case, any
version greater than 1.0.0.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
packages:

 newpkg_app1::

  "app1"

    package_policy           => "update",
    package_select           => ">=",
    package_architectures    => { "i586" },
    package_version          => "1.0.0",
    package_method           => rpm_version("/software_repo"),
    classes                  => if_else("app1_update", "app1_noupdate");
}
```

By promising carefully what package and version you want, using package_policy,
package_select, and package_version, CFEngine can keep this promise by updating
to the latest version of the package available in the directory repository
/software_repo. If the available versions are all `less than' than "1.0.0", an
update will not take place. The package_version specification should match the
versioning format of the software, whatever it is, e.g. you would write
something like "1.00.00.0" if two digits were used in the two middle version
number positions.


CFEngine automatically adapts its versioning to the conventions used by
individual package schemas.


To summarize, in order for CFEngine to be able to match installed packages with
the ones in the directory repository, the same naming convention must be
applied. That is, the package name, version and architecture must have the same
format in the list of installed packages as the file names of available
packages.

From the promise above, we see that CFEngine will interpret app1 as the name,
1.0.0 as the version and i586 as the architecture of the package. Using this
while looking at the package_name_convention in the rpm package method, we see
that CFEngine will look for packages named as app1-X.Y.Z-i586.rpm, with X, Y, Z
producing the largest version available in the directory repository. If an
available version is larger than the one installed, an update will take place —
the update command is run.

Finally, we set classes from the software update in case we want to act
differently depending on the outcome.

Replacing the policy 'update' with 'add' is all that is required to install the
package (once) instead of updating. Using policy 'add' will do nothing if the
package is already installed, but installs the largest version available if it
is not. Use package_select => "==" to install the exact version instead of the
largest.

### Adapting to Windows

To adapt our example to Windows, we change the path to the local software
repository from/software_repotoc:\software_repo, to support the Windows path
format. Other than that, all we have to change is thepackage_method, yielding
the following.

```
package_method           => msi_version("c:\software_repo"),
```

Refer to the msi_version body in the standard library.

### Notes on Windows systems

CFEngine implements Windows packaging using the MSI subsystem, internally
querying the Windows Management Interface for information. However, not all
Windows systems have the reqired information.

CFEngine relies on the name (lower-cased with spaces replaced by hyphen) and
version fields found inside the msi packages to look for upgrades in the package
repository.

Problems can arise when the format of these fields differ from their format in
the file names. For example, a package file name may be 7zip-4.65-x86_64.msi,
while the product name in the msi is given as 7-Zip 4.65 (x64 edition), and the
version is 4.65.00.0.

For the formats to match, we can change the product name to 7zip and the version
to 4.65 in the msi-package. Free tools such as InstEd can both view and change
the product name and version (Tables->Property->ProductName and ProductVersion).

## Customizing applications


By definition, we cannot explain how to customize software for all cases. For
Unix-like systems however, software customization is usually a matter of editing
a configuration text file. CFEngine can edit files, for instance, to add a
configuration line to a file, you might so something like this:

```cf3
bundle agent my_application_customize
{
  files:

    "$(prefix)/config.cf"

          comment => "Set the permissions and add a line...",
        perms     => mo("0600","root"),
        edit_line => append_if_no_line("My custom setting...");
}
```

To set a number of variables inside a file, you might do something like this:

```cf3
bundle agent my_application_customize
{
  vars:

    # want to set these values by the names of their array keys

    "rhs[serverhost]" string => "123.456.789.123";
    "rhs[portnumber]" string => "1234";
    "rhs[admin]"      string => "admin@example.org";

  files:

    "$(prefix)/config.cf"

         comment => "Add new variables or set existing ones",
       edit_line => set_variable_values("setvars.rhs");

}
```

You can also create file templates with customizable variables using
theexpand_templatemethod from the standard library.

## Starting and stopping software

CFEngine is promise or compliance oriented. You promise whether software will be
running or not running at different times and locations by making processes or
services promises.

To start a service, you might do something like this:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
processes:

   "myprocess"  restart_class => "start_me";

commands:


  start_me::

    "/path/to/software"

         # ... many security options, etc
}
```

or using services

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
services:

 windows::

  "Dhcp"
    service_policy => "start",
    service_dependencies => { "Alerter", "W32Time" },
    service_method => winmethod;
}
```

To stop a service, you take one of these approaches:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  processes:

   "badprocess"
      signals => { "term", "kill" };

   "snmp"
      process_stop => "/etc/init.d/snmp stop";
}
```

## Auditing software applications

Commercial Editions of CFEngine generate reports about installed software,
showing package names and versions that are installed. There is a huge variety
in the functionality offered by different package systems. The most
sophisticated package managers are those provided by OpenSuSE Linux and RedHat.
These know the difference between installation packages and software updates and
can keep track of installed software transparently. Most package systems have
fewer functions.

CFEngine tries to make the best of each package system to collect information
about the state of software. In commercial editions you have access to reports
on the software installed on each system in the network, to the extent permitted
by the software subsystems on those hosts.
