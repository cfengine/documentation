# From boiler-plates to convergent file editing

Many configuration management systems allow you to determine configuration file
content to some extent, usually by over-writing files with boiler-plate
(template) files. This approach works for some cases, but it is a blunt and
inflexible instrument, which forces you to take over the ownership of the file
`all or nothing' and determine its entire content yourself. This is more than is
necessary or desirable in general.

Other approaches to file editing us search and replace, e.g. with the
long-standing Unix tools awk and sed. Adding a user to a structured file such as
the password file, only if the user is not already defined, is a more complex
operation.

Cfengine allows you to model both whole files and parts of files, in any format,
and promise that these fragments will satisfy certain promises about their
state. This is potentially different from more common templating approaches to
file management in which pre-adjusted copies of files are generated for all
recipients at a single location and then distributed.

The most important thing about making changes to files is that the result end up
being predictable. There are three ways to approach this problem. You should
choose the simplest approach that solves your problem and try not to be
prejudiced by what you have done before.

# Why is file editing difficult?

File content is not made up of simple data objects like permission flags or
process tables: files contain compound, ordered structures (known as grammars)
and they cannot always be determined from a single source of information. To
determine the outcome of a file we have to adopt either a fully deterministic
approach, or live with a partial approximation.

Some approaches to file editing try to `know' the intended format of a file, by
hardcoding it. If the file then fails to follow this format, the algorithms
might break. CFEngine gives you generic tools to be able to handle files in any
line-based format, without the need to hard-code specialist knowledge about file
formats.

Remember that all changes are adapted to your local context and implemented at
the final destination by cf-agent.

# What does file editing involve?


There are several ways to approach desired state management of file contents:

 * Copy a finished file template to the desired location, completely overwriting
   existing content.

 * Copy and adapt an almost finished template, filling in variables or macros to
   yield a desired content.

 * Make corrections to whatever the existing state of the file might be.

There are advantages and disadvantages with each of these approaches and the
best approach depends on the type of situation you need to describe.

For the approach 	Against the approach
1. Deterministic. 	Hard to specialize the result and the source must still be maintained by hand.
2. Deterministic. 	Limited specialization and must come from a single source, again maintained by hand.
3. Non-deterministic/partial model. 	Full power to customize file even with multiple managers.


Approaches 1 and 2 are best for situations where very few variations of a file
are needed in different circumstances. Approach 3 is best when you need to
customize a file significantly, especially when you don't know the full details
of the file you are starting from. Approach 3 is generally required when
adapting configuration files provided by a third party, since the basic content
is determined by them.

# Three approaches to managing files

* Copying a finished file template into place

* Contextual adaptation of a file template

* Example file template

* Combining copy with template expansion

* Making delta changes to someone else's file

## Copying a finished file template into place

Use this approach if a simple substution of data will solve the problem in all
contexts.

* Maintain the content of the file in a version controlled repository.

* Check out the file into a staging area.

* Copy the file into place.

```cf3
bundle agent something
{
files:

  "/important/file"

  copy_from => secure_cp("/repository/important_file_template","svn-host");
}
```

## Contextual adaptation of a file template

There are several approaches here:

* Encode the boiler-plate template directly in the CFEngine configuration, and
  have full use of the power of the CFEngine language to adapt it.

* Keep a separate boiler-plate file and edit/adapt it.

* Copy a template from a repository then edit/adapt it.

* Copy a generic template with embedded variables that can be expanded like
  macro-substitution.

Choose the approach that you consider to be simplest and most reliable for the
purpose you need. Don't use templating, for instance, simply because it is what
you are used to, or you might waste a lot of time and effort maintaining data
that you don't need to.

To expand a template file on a local disk:

```cf3
bundle agent templating
{
files:

  "/home/mark/tmp/file_based_on_template"

       create => "true",
    edit_line => expand_template("/tmp/source_template");
}
```

As of CFEngine version 3.3.0 you can also use a new templating file format and
write:

```cf3
bundle agent templating
{
files:

  "/home/mark/tmp/file_based_on_template"

       create => "true",
    edit_template => "/tmp/source_template";
}
```

For example, the source template file might look like this, with embedded
CFEngine variables:

```
     mail_relay = $(sys.fqhost)
     important_user = $(mybundle.variable)
     #...
```

These variables will be filled in by CFEngine assuming they are defined within
your CFEngine configuration.

If you use the new edit_template promise, you can embed directives to CFEngine
context-classes and mark out regions of a file to be treated as an iteratable
block.

```
#This is a template file /templates/input.tmpl

These lines apply to anyone

[%CFEngine solaris.Monday:: %]
Everything after here applies only to solaris on Mondays
until overridden...

[%CFEngine linux:: %]
Everything after here now applies now to linux only.

[%CFEngine BEGIN %]
This is a block of text
That contains list variables: $(some.list)
With text before and after.
[%CFEngine END %]

nameserver $(some.list)
```

For example: if we use this template in a promise:

```cf3
bundle agent test
{
  vars:
   "var" slist => { "1", "2", "3"};

  files:
    "/tmp/expander"
           create => "true",
    edit_template => "/templates/input.tmpl";
}
```

The result would look like this, on a linux host:

```
#This is a template file /templates/input.tmpl

These lines apply to anyone
Everything after here now applies now to linux only.
This is a block of text
That contains list variables: 1
With text before and after.
This is a block of text
That contains list variables: 2
With text before and after.
This is a block of text
That contains list variables: 3
With text before and after.
nameserver 1
nameserver 2
nameserver 3
```

## Example file template

```
[%CFEngine any:: %]
<VirtualHost $(sys.ipv4[eth0]):80>
        ServerAdmin             $(stage_file.params[apache_mail_address][1])
        DocumentRoot            /var/www/htdocs
        ServerName              $(stage_file.params[apache_server_name][1])
        AddHandler              cgi-script cgi
        ErrorLog                /var/log/httpd/error.log
        AddType                 application/x-x509-ca-cert .crt
        AddType                 application/x-pkcs7-crl    .crl
        SSLEngine               off
        CustomLog               /var/log/httpd/access.log
</VirtualHost>

[%CFEngine webservers_prod:: %]
[%CFEngine BEGIN %]
<VirtualHost $(sys.ipv4[$(bundle.interfaces)]):443>
        ServerAdmin             $(stage_file.params[apache_mail_address][1])
        DocumentRoot            /var/www/htdocs
        ServerName              $(stage_file.params[apache_server_name][1])
        AddHandler              cgi-script cgi

        AddType                 application/x-pkcs7-crl    .crl
        SSLEngine               on
        SSLCertificateFile      $(stage_file.params[apache_ssl_crt][1])
        SSLCertificateKeyFile   $(stage_file.params[apache_ssl_key][1])
        CustomLog               /var/log/httpd/access.log
</VirtualHost>
[%CFEngine END %]
```

## Combining copy with template expansion

What about getting your template to the end-host? To convergently copy a file
from a source and then edit it, use the following construction with a staging
file.

```
bundle agent master
{
files:
  "$(final_destination)"
         create => "true",
     edit_line => fix_file("$(staging_file)"),
 edit_defaults => empty,
         perms => mo("644","root"),
        action => if_elapsed("60");
}

bundle edit_line fix_file(f)
{
insert_lines:
  "$(f)"
     insert_type => "file";
     # expand_scalars => "true" ;

replace_patterns:
    "searchstring"
          replace_with => value("replacestring");
}
```

## Making delta changes to someone else's file

Edit a file with multiple promises about its state, when you do not want to
determine the entire content of the file, or if it is unsafe to make unilateral
changes, e.g. because its contents are also being managed from another source
like a software package manager.

For modifying a file, you have access to the full power of text editing
promises. This is a powerful framework.

```cf3
# Resolve conf edit

body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "g", resolver(@(g.searchlist),@(g.nameservers)) };
inputs => { "cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

bundle common g # global
{
vars:
 "searchlist"  slist => { "example.com", "cfengine.com" };
 "nameservers" slist => { "10.1.1.10", "10.3.2.16", "8.8.8.8" };

classes:
  "am_name_server"
     expression => reglist("@(nameservers)","$(sys.ipv4[eth1])");
}

bundle agent resolver(s,n)
{
files:
  "$(sys.resolv)"  # test on "/tmp/resolv.conf" #
      create        => "true",
      edit_line     => doresolv("@(this.s)","@(this.n)"),
      edit_defaults => empty;
}

# For your private library ......................

bundle edit_line doresolv(s,n)
{
insert_lines:
  "search $(s)";
  "nameserver $(n)";
delete_lines:
 # To clean out junk
  "nameserver .*| search .*" not_matching => "true";
}
```

# Constructing files from promises


Making finished templates for files and filling in the blanks using variables is
a flexble approach in many cases, but it is not flexible enough for all cases. A
very flexible approach, but one that requires more thought, is to build a final
result (desired end-state) from a set of promises about what the file should
contain. This might or might not include templates in the sense of complete
files that are read in.

If you are using CFEngine 3.3 or later, you have the option of using
edit_template and its embedded language constructs to keep decisions and loops
inside templates. Let's set aside that for a while and look at the alternatives,
placing the data entirely within bundles of `edit'-promises.

There is language support for this kind of editing in the standard library, and
you can store data and template components within a CFEngine configuration
itself, or as a separate file. For example:

```cf3
#

body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "main" };
inputs => { "LapTop/cfengine/copbl/cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

#

bundle common data
{
vars:
  "person" string => "Mary";
  "animal" string => "a little lamb";
}

#

bundle agent main
{
files:
   "/tmp/my_result"
        create => "true",
     edit_line => expand_template("/tmp/my_template_source"),
 edit_defaults => empty;
}
```

Suppose the filemy_template_sourcecontains the following text:

```
This is a file template containing variables to expand

e.g $(data.person) had $(data.animal)
```


Then we would have the file content:

```console
host$ more /tmp/my_result
   This is a file template containing variables to expand

   e.g Mary had a little lamb
```

## Adding a line here and there

A simple file like this could also be defined in-line, without a separate
template file:

```cf3
body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "main" };
inputs => { "LapTop/cfengine/copbl/cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

#

bundle common data
{
vars:
  "person" string => "Mary";
  "animal" string => "a little lamb";
}

#

bundle agent main
{
vars:
  "content" string =>
    "This is a file template containing variables to expand
e.g $(data.person) had $(data.animal)";

files:

   "/tmp/my_result"
        create => "true",
     edit_line => append_if_no_line("$(content)"),
 edit_defaults => empty;
}
```

## Lists inline


Here is a more complicated example, that includes list expansion. List expansion
(iteration) adds some trickiness because it is an ordered process, which needs
to be anchored somehow.

```cf3
body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "main" };
inputs => { "LapTop/cfengine/copbl/cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

#

bundle common data
{
vars:

  "person" string => "Mary";
  "animal" string => "a little lamb";

  "mylist" slist => { "one", "two", "three" };
  "clocks" slist => { "five", "six", "seven" };

  # or read the list from a file with readstringlist()

}

#

bundle agent main
{
files:


   "/tmp/my_result"

        create => "true",
     edit_line => my_expand_template,
 edit_defaults => empty;
}

#

bundle edit_line my_expand_template
{
vars:

 # import the lists, due to current limitation

 "mylist" slist => { @(data.mylist) };
 "clocks" string => join(", ","data.clocks");
 "other"  string => "eight";

insert_lines:

   "
   This is a file template containing variables to expand

   e.g $(data.person) had $(data.animal)

   and it said:
   ";

   "
   $(mylist) o'clock ";
   "
   ROCK!
   $(clocks) o'clock, $(other) o'clock
   ";

   "   ROCK!
   The end.
   "

   insert_type => "preserve_block"; # So we keep duplicate line
}
```

This results in a file output containing:

```console
host$ ~/LapTop/cfengine/core/src/cf-agent -f ./test.cf -K
host$ more /tmp/my_result

   This is a file template containing variables to expand

   e.g Mary had a little lamb

   and it said:

   one o'clock
   two o'clock
   three o'clock
   ROCK!
   five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock
   ROCK!
   The end.
```

Splitting this example into several promises seems unnecessary and inconvenient,
so we could use a special function join() to make pre-expand the scalar list and
insert it as a single object:

```cf3
body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "main" };
inputs => { "LapTop/cfengine/copbl/cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

#

bundle common data
{
vars:

  "person" string => "Mary";
  "animal" string => "a little lamb";

  "mylist" slist => { "one", "two", "three", "" };
  "clocks" slist => { "five", "six", "seven" };

  # or read the list from a file with readstringlist()

}

#

bundle agent main
{
files:


   "/tmp/my_result"

        create => "true",
     edit_line => my_expand_template,
 edit_defaults => empty;
}

#

bundle edit_line my_expand_template
{
vars:

 # import the lists, due to current limitation

 "mylist" string => join(" o'clock$(const.n)  ","data.mylist");
 "clocks" string => join(", ","data.clocks");
 "other" string => "eight";

insert_lines:

   "
   This is a file template containing variables to expand

   e.g $(data.person) had $(data.animal)

   and it said:

   $(mylist)
   ROCK!
   $(clocks) o'clock, $(other) o'clock
   ROCK!
   The end.
   "

   insert_type => "preserve_block"; # So we keep duplicate line
}
```

Finally, since this is now entirely contained within a single set of quotes
(i.e. there is a single promiser), we could replace the in-line template with
one read from a file:

```
#

body common control
{
bundlesequence => { "main" };
inputs => { "LapTop/cfengine/copbl/cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

#

bundle common data
{
vars:

  "person" string => "Mary";
  "animal" string => "a little lamb";

  "mylist" slist => { "one", "two", "three", "" };
  "clocks" slist => { "five", "six", "seven" };

  # or read the list from a file with readstringlist()

}

#

bundle agent main
{
files:


   "/tmp/my_result"

        create => "true",
     edit_line => my_expand_template,
 edit_defaults => empty;
}

#

bundle edit_line my_expand_template
{
vars:

 # import the lists, due to current limitation

 "mylist" string => join(" o'clock$(const.n)  ","data.mylist");
 "clocks" string => join(", ","data.clocks");
 "other" string => "eight";

insert_lines:

   "/tmp/my_template_source"
     expand_scalars => "true",
     insert_type => "file";
}
```

# Editing bundles

Unlike other aspects of configuration, promising the content of a single file
object involves possibly many promises about the atoms within the file. Thus we
need to be able to state bundles of promises for what happens inside a file and
tie it (like a body-template) to the files promise. This is done using an
edit_line => or edit_xml => constraint1, for instance:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:

    "/etc/passwd"

       create => "true",
       # other constraints on file container ...
       edit_line => mybundle("one","two","three");
}
```

Editing bundles are defined like other bundles for the agent, except that they
have a type given by the left hand side of the constraint (just like body
templates):

```cf3
bundle edit_line mybundle(arg1,arg2,arg3)
{
insert_lines:

   "newuser:x:1111:110:A new user:/home/newuser:/bin/bash";
   "$(arg1):x:$(arg2):110:$(arg3):/home/$(arg1):/bin/bash";
}
```

* Standard library methods for simple editing

* Expressing expand_template as promises

## Standard library methods for simple editing

You may choose to write your own editing bundles for specific purposes; you can
also use ready-made templates from the standard library for a lot of purposes.
If you follow the guidelines for choosing an approach to editing below, you will
be able to re-use standard methods in perhaps most cases. Using standard library
code keeps your own intentions clear and easily communicable. For example, to
insert hello into a file at the end once only:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:

    "/tmp/test_insert"

         create => "true",
      edit_line => append_if_no_line("hello"),
  edit_defaults => empty;
}
```

Or to set the shell for a user

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:

    "/etc/passwd"
         create    => "true",
         edit_line => set_user_field("mark","7","/my/favourite/shell");
}
```

Some other examples of the standard editing methods are:

* append_groups_starting(v)
* append_if_no_line(str)
* append_if_no_lines(list)
* append_user_field(group,field,allusers)
* append_users_starting(v)
* comment_lines_containing(regex,comment)
* edit_line comment_lines_matching(regex,comment)
* delete_lines_matching(regex)
* expand_template(templatefile)
* insert_lines(lines)
* resolvconf(search,list)
* set_user_field(user,field,val)
* set_variable_values(v)
* set_variable_values2(v)
* uncomment_lines_containing(regex,comment)
* uncomment_lines_matching(regex,comment)
* warn_lines_matching(regex)

You find these in the documentation for the COPBL.

## Expressing expand_template as promises

As on CFEngine 3.3.0, CFEngine has a new template mechanism to make it easier to
encode complex file templates. These templates map simply to edit_line bundles
in the following way.

* Each line in a template maps to a separate insert_lines promise unless it is
  grouped with '[%CFEngine BEGIN %]' and '[%CFEngine END %]' tags.

* Each multi-line group, marked with '[%CFEngine BEGIN %]' and
  '[%CFEngine END %]' tags maps to a multi-line insert_lines promise, with
  insert_type => "preserve_block".

* Each line that expresses a context-class: '[%CFEngine classexpression:: %]'
  maps to a normal class expression in a bundle.

The order of lines in the template is preserved within each block, or if
edit_defaults is used to empty the resulting generated file before editing: e.g.
with the standard library method:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  "/tmp/expander"

           create => "true",
    edit_template => "/home/a10004/input.dat",
    edit_defaults => empty;
}
```

# Choosing an approach to file editing

There are two decisions to make when choosing how to manage file content:

How can the desired content be constructed from the necessary source(s)?

* Is there more than one source of infromation that needs to be merged?

* Do the contents need to be adapted to the specific environment?

* Is there context-specific information in the file?

Use the simplest approach that requires the smallest number of promises to solve
the problem.

# Pitfalls to watch out for in file editing

File editing is different from most other kinds of configuration promise because
it is fundamentally an order dependent configuration process. Files contain
non-regular grammars. CFEngine attempts to simplify the problem by using models
for the file structure, essentially factoring out as much of the context
dependence as possible.

Order dependence increases the fragility of maintainence, so you should do what
you can to minimize it.

* Try to use substitution within a known template if order is important.

The simplest kinds of files for configuration are line-based, with no special
order. For such cases, simple line insertions are usually enough to configure
files.

The increasing introduction of XML for configuration is a major headache for
configuration management.
