# `cf-agent`

Active agent - responsible for maintaining promises about the state
of your system (in CFEngine 2 the agent was called `cfagent`). You
can run `cf-agent` manually, but if you want to have it run on a
regular basis, you should use `cf-execd` (instead of
using `cron`).

`cf-agent` keeps the promises made in `common`
and `agent` bundles, and is affected by
`common` and `agent` control bodies.
