`cf-hub` connects to `cf-serverd` instances to collect data
about a host managed by CFEngine. `cf-agent` and `cf-monitord`
both store data at host in local databases. `cf-hub` connects to a
`cf-serverd` instance running at a host and collect the data into its own
central database. `cf-hub` automatically schedules data collection from hosts
that have registered a connection with a collocated `cf-serverd`

`cf-hub` keeps the promises made in `common`, and is affected by
`common` and `hub` control bodies.

`cf-hub` collects data generated from the default run only, what you'd
get if you ran `cf-agent` without specifying a file name.  This is to
avoid reporting on data generated by test or extraordinary executions.

## Control Promises

```cf3
    body hub control
    {
    export_zenoss => "/var/www/reports/summary.z";
    }
```

### export_zenoss

**Description:** Generate report for Zenoss integration

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `.+`

**Example:**

    body hub control
    {
    am_policy_hub::

      export_zenoss => "/var/www/reports/summary.z";
    }

**Notes:**

For integration with the Zenoss monitoring software.

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.1.0b1, Enterprise 2.0.0b1 (2010)

### exclude_hosts

**Description:** A list of IP addresses of hosts to exclude from
report collection

This list of IP addresses will not be queried for reports by ```cf-hub```, even
though they are in the last-seen database.

The lists may contain network addresses in CIDR notation or regular
expressions to match the IP address. However, host names are
currently not supported.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

    body hub control
    {
    exclude_hosts => { "192.168.12.21", "10.10", "10.12.*" };
    }

**Notes:**

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Enterprise 2.1.1 (2011)

### hub_schedule

**Description:** List of classes indicating when pull collection round should be initiated.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Default value:** `{ "Min00", "Min05", "Min10", "Min15", "Min20", "Min25", "Min30", "Min35", "Min40", "Min45", "Min50", "Min55" }`
 
**Example:**

```cf3
body hub control
{

  # Collect reports every at the top and half of the hour. Additionally collect
  # reports during the evening or night between Minute 45 and 50.

  hub_schedule => { "Min00", "Min30", "(Evening|Night).Min45_50" };

}
```

**History:**

- Introduced in version 3.1.0b1, Enterprise 2.0.0b1 (2010)

### port

**Description:** Default port for contacting hosts

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `1024,99999`

**Default value:** 5308

**Examples**:

```cf3
    body hub control
    {
    port => "5308";
    }

    body server control
    {
    specialhost::
     port => "5308";

    !specialhost::
     port => "5308";
    }
```

**Notes:**

The standard or registered port number is tcp/5308. CFEngine does not
presently use its registered udp port with the same number, but this could
change in the future.

Changing the standard port number is not recommended practice. You should not
do it without a good reason.


### client_history_timeout

**Description:** If the hub can't reach a client for this many (or more) hours,
it will not collect the missed reports and it will continue collection
from current time. This is done to speed-up report collection
and minimize data transfer. The default value is 6 hours.

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `1,65535`

**Default value:** 6

**Examples**:

```cf3
    body hub control
    {
    client_history_timeout => 6;
    }
```

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.6.4 and is not compatible with older CFEngine versions.
