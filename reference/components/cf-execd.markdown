`cf-execd` is the scheduling daemon for `cf-agent`. It runs
`cf-agent` locally according to a schedule specified in policy code (executor
control body). After a `cf-agent` run is completed, `cf-execd` gathers output
from `cf-agent`, and may be configured to email the output to a specified
address. It may also be configured to [splay][cf-execd#splaytime] (randomize)
the execution schedule to prevent synchronized `cf-agent` runs across a
network.

`cf-execd` keeps the promises made in `common` bundles, and is affected by
`common` and `executor` control bodies.

**Notes:**

* This daemon reloads it's config when the SIGHUP signal is received.
* `cf-execd` always considers the class ```executor``` to be defined.


**History:**

- SIGHUP behavior added in 3.7.0

## Control promises

These body settings determine the behavior of `cf-execd`,including scheduling
times and output capture to `WORKDIR/outputs` and relay via email.

```cf3
body executor control
{
    splaytime  => "5";
    mailto     => "cfengine@example.org";
    mailfrom   => "cfengine@$(host).example.org";
    smtpserver => "localhost";
    schedule   => { "Min00", "Min30" }
}
```


### agent_expireafter

**Description:** Maximum agent runtime (in minutes)

Sets a maximum time on any run of the command in `exec_command`. If
no data is received from the pipe opened to the process created
with `exec_command` after the time has elapsed, the process gets
killed.

Note that if you have long-running jobs, they may get killed with
this setting. Therefore, you should ensure it is higher than any
run of `cf-agent` that you want to leave alone. Alternatively, you
can make your jobs output something to STDOUT at least as often as
this threshold. This will reset the timer.

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,10080`

**Default value:** 120

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
agent_expireafter => "120";
}
```

**Notes:**
The setting will effectively allow you to set a threshold on the
number of simultaneous agents that are running. For example, if you
set it to `120` and you are using a 5-minute agent schedule, a
maximum of 120 / 5 = 24 agents should be enforced.

### executorfacility

**Description:** Menu option for syslog facility level

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**

    LOG_USER
    LOG_DAEMON
    LOG_LOCAL0
    LOG_LOCAL1
    LOG_LOCAL2
    LOG_LOCAL3
    LOG_LOCAL4
    LOG_LOCAL5
    LOG_LOCAL6
    LOG_LOCAL7

See the syslog manual pages.

**Default value:** `LOG_USER`

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
executorfacility => "LOG_USER";
}
```

### exec_command

**Description:** The full path and command to the executable run by
default (overriding `builtin`)

The command is run in a shell encapsulation so pipes and shell
symbols may be used if desired.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `"?(/.*)`

**Note:** If `exec_command` is not defined `cf-agent` will be executed with the `failsafe.cf` policy.

**Example:**

    exec_command => "$(sys.workdir)/bin/cf-agent -f update.cf && $(sys.workdir)/bin/cf-agent";

### mailfilter_exclude

**Description:** List of [anchored][anchored] regular expressions that, if
matched by a log entry, will cause that log entry to be excluded from agent
execution emails.

If no filter is set, `cf-execd` acts as if no log entry matches the exclude
pattern. If a log entry also matches a pattern in `mailfilter_include`, the
exclude pattern takes precedence.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `.*`

**Note:** Merely adding or removing a pattern that causes the number of matching
log entries to change, does not guarantee that the next agent execution will
generate an email from cf-execd. The actual output from cf-agent still has to be
different from the previous run for an email to be generated.

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    # Ignore agent execution emails about permission errors.
    mailfilter_exclude => { ".*Permission denied.*" };
}
```

**History:** Introduced in CFEngine 3.9.

### mailfilter_include

**Description:** List of [anchored][anchored] regular expressions that must
match a log entry in order for it to be included in agent execution emails.

If no filter is set, `cf-execd` acts as if every log entry matches the include
pattern. If a log entry also matches a pattern in `mailfilter_exclude`, the
exclude pattern takes precedence.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `.*`

**Note:** Merely adding or removing a pattern that causes the number of matching
log entries to change, does not guarantee that the next agent execution will
generate an email from cf-execd. The actual output from cf-agent still has to be
different from the previous run for an email to be generated.

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    # Only include reports in agent execution emails.
    mailfilter_include => { "R:.*" };
}
```

**History:** Introduced in CFEngine 3.9.

### mailfrom

**Description:** Email-address CFEngine mail appears to come from

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `.*@.*`

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    mailfrom => "mrcfengine@example.org";
}
```

### mailmaxlines

**Description:** Maximum number of lines of output to send by email

This limit prevents anomalously large outputs from clogging up a system
administrator's mailbox. The output is truncated in the email report, but the
complete original transcript is stored in `WORKDIR/outputs/*` where it can be
viewed on demand. A reference to the appropriate file is given.

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,1000`

**Default value:** 30

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
mailmaxlines => "100";
}
```

### mailsubject

**Description:** The subject in the mail sent by CFEngine.

The subject can contain system variables, like for example IP address or
architecture.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `.*`

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    mailsubject => "CFEngine report ($(sys.fqhost))";
}
```

### mailto

**Description:** Email-address CFEngine mail is sent to

The address to whom email is sent if an smtp host is configured.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `.*@.*`

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    mailto => "cfengine_alias@example.org";
}
```

### schedule

**Description:** The class schedule used by cf-execd for activating
cf-agent

The list should contain class expressions comprised of classes
which are visible to the `cf-execd` daemon. In principle, any
defined class expression will cause the daemon to wake up and
schedule the execution of the `cf-agent`. In practice, the classes
listed in the list are usually date- and time-based.

The actual execution of `cf-agent` may be delayed by `splaytime`,
and may be deferred by promise caching and the value of
[`ifelapsed`][cf-agent#ifelapsed]. Note also that the effectiveness of the `splayclass`
function may be affected by changing the `schedule`.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Default value:**

    schedule => { "Min00", "Min05", "Min10", "Min15", "Min20", "Min25",
              "Min30", "Min35", "Min40", "Min45", "Min50", "Min55" };

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
schedule => { "Min00", "(Evening|Night).Min15", "Min30", "(Evening|Night).Min45" };
}
```

### smtpserver

**Description:** Name or IP of a willing smtp server for sending
email

This should point to a standard port 25 server without encryption. If you are
running secured or encrypted email then you should run a mail relay on
localhost and point this to localhost.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `.*`

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    smtpserver => "smtp.example.org";
}
```

### splaytime

**Description:** Time in minutes to splay this host based on its name
hash

Whenever any class listed in the `schedule` attribute is present,
`cf-execd` can schedule an execution of `cf-agent`. The actual
execution will be delayed an integer number of seconds between
0-`splaytime` minutes. The specific amount of delay for "this" host
is based on a hash of the hostname. Thus a collection of hosts will
all execute at different times, and surges in network traffic can
be avoided.

A general rule for scaling of small updates is to set the splay time to
runinterval-1 minutes for up a few thousand hosts. For example, the default
schedule executes once every 5 minutes, so the splay time should be set to no
more than 4 minutes. The `splaytime` should be set to a value less than the
`cf-execd` scheduling interval, else multiple clients might contend for data.
In other words, `splaytime` + `cf-agent` run time should be less than the
scheduling interval.

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Default value:** 0

The CFEngine default policy sets `splaytime` to 1.

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    splaytime => "2";
}
```

**See also:** The [`splayclass()`][splayclass] function for a task-specific
means for setting splay times.

### runagent_socket_allow_users

**Description:** Users who are allowed access the socket (`STATEDIR/cf-execd.sockets/runagent.socket`).

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `.*`

**Default value:** none

**Notes:**

* By default, in the Masterfiles Policy Framework, `cfapache` is allowed to access the socket on Enterprise Hubs.

**Example:**

```cf3
body executor control
{
    runagent_socket_allow_users => { "yoda", "obi-wan" };
}
```

**See also:** [`cf-runagent`][cf-runagent]

**History:**

* 3.18.0 Added `runagent_socket_allow_users` attribute

## Sockets

`cf-execd` creates `STATEDIR/cf-execd.sockets/runagent.socket` (`/var/cfengine/state/cf-execd.sockets/runagent.socket`).

The `body executor control` attribute `runagent_socket_allow_users` controls the list of users that should be allowed to access (**RW**) the socket via ACLs.

**Notes:**

* Unlike execution triggered with the `cf-runagent` binary, there is currently no capability to define additional options like defining additional classes, or the remote bundlesequence.

**Example:**

Write the name or IP into the socket to request unscheduled execution on that host:

```console
echo 'host001' > /var/cfengine/state/cf-execd.sockets/cf-runagent.socket
```

**See also:** [`cf-runagent`][cf-runagent], [`runagent_socket_allow_users`][cf-execd#runagent_socket_allow_users]

**History:**

* 3.18.0 Added socket for triggering `cf-runagent` by hostname or IP.
