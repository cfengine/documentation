# `cf-execd`

Scheduler - responsible for running `cf-agent` on a regular (and
user-configurable) basis (in CFEngine 2 the scheduler was called
`cfexecd`). It collects the output of the agent and can email it to a
specified address. It can splay the start time of executions across
the network and work as a class-based clock for scheduling.

`cf-execd` keeps the promises made in
`common` bundles, and is affected by
`common` and `executor` control
bodies.
