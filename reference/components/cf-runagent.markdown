# `cf-runagent`

Remote run agent - used to execute `cf-agent` on a remote machine
(in CFEngine 2 the remote run agent was called `cfrun`).
`cf-runagent` does not keep any promises, but instead is used to
ask another machine to do so.

The run agent connects to a list of running instances of the
`cf-serverd` service. The agent allows a user to forego the usual
scheduling interval for the agent and activate `cf-agent` on a remote
host. Additionally, a user can send additional classes to be
defined on the remote host. Two kinds of classes may be sent:
classes to decide on which hosts the agent will be started, and
classes that the user requests the agent should define on
execution. The latter type is regulated by `cf-serverd`'s role based
access control.
