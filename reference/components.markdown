**TODO: write more technical details about the binaries, file structure
and package content. Link components to bundle types**

While promises to configure your system are entirely user-defined, the
details of the operational behavior of the CFEngine software is of
course hard-coded. You can still configure the details of this
behavior using the control promise bodies. Control behavior is
defined in bodies because the actual promises are fixed and you only
change their details within sensible limits.

See the [manual](manuals-architecture-components.html) for a 
high-level overview of the CFEngine components.
