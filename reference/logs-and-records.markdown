CFEngine  approaches monitoring and reporting from the viewpoint of 
scalability so there is no default centralization of reporting information, as 
this is untenable for more than a few hundred hosts. Instead, in the classic 
CFEngine way, every host is responsible for its own data.

On hosts, CFEngine writes numerous logs and records to its private workspace, 
referred  to as 
[`WORKDIR`](manuals-architecture-work-directory.html) in the 
documentation. The `outputs` directory contains a time-stamped list of outputs generated by `cf-agent`. These are collected by `cf-execd` and are often emailed as reports. However, not all hosts have an email capability or are online, so the reports are kept here. Reports are not tidied automatically, so you should delete these files after a time to avoid a build up.

CFEngine Enterprise provides solutions for centralization and network-wide 
reporting at arbitrary scale.

**TODO: more please!**
