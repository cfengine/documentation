The CFEngine components keep their current process identifier number in
`pid files' in the work directory. For example:

    cf-execd.pid
    cf-serverd.pid

Most other state data refer to the running condition of the host and are
generated by `cf-monitord` (`cfenvd` in earlier versions of CFEngine).

* `state/env_data`

This file contains a list of currently discovered classes and variable
values that characterize the anomaly alert environment. They are altered
by the monitor daemon.   

* `state/all_classes`

A list of all the classes that were defined the last time that CFEngine
was run.   

* `state/cf_*`

All files that begin with this prefix refer to cached data that were
observed by the monitor daemon, and may be used by `cf-agent` in
`reports` with `showstate`.
