Within a bundle, the promise types are executed in a round-robin fashion in 
the following 'normal ordering'. Which promise types are available depends on 
the [bundle][bundles] type:

| Promise Type   | common | agent | server | monitor |
|----------------|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------|
| [meta][meta] - information about promise bundles | x      | x     | x      | x       |

See each promise type's reference documentation for detailed lists of 
available attributes.

## Common Attributes

The following attributes are available to all promise types.

### action

**Type:** `body action`

#### action_policy

**Description:** Determines whether to repair or report about non-kept 
promises

The `action` settings allow general transaction control to be implemented on 
promise verification. Action bodies place limits on how often to verify the 
promise and what classes to raise in the case that the promise can or cannot 
be kept.

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**   

```
    fix
    warn
    nop
```

**Example:**

The following example shows a simple use of transaction control:

```cf3
     body action warn_only
     {
     action_policy => "warn";
     ifelapsed => "60";
     }
```

Note that actions can be added to sub-bundles like methods and editing 
bundles, and that promises within these do not inherit action settings 
at higher levels. Thus, in the following example there are two levels
of action setting:

```cf3
     body common control
     {
     bundlesequence  => { "testbundle" };
     }
     
     bundle agent testbundle
     {
     files:
     
       "/var/cfengine/inputs/.*"
     
            edit_line => DeleteLinesMatching(".*cfenvd.*"),
            action => WarnOnly;
     }
     
     bundle edit_line DeleteLinesMatching(regex)
     {
       delete_lines:
     
         "$(regex)" action => WarnOnly;
     
     }
     
     body action WarnOnly
     {
       action_policy => "warn";
     }
```

**Notes:**
The `action` setting for the `files` promise means that file edits will
not be committed to disk, only warned about. This is a master-level
promise that overrides anything that happens during the editing. The
`action` setting in the `edit_line` bundle means that the internal memory
modeling of the file will only warn about changes rather than
committing them to the memory model. This makes little difference to the
end result, but it means that CFEngine will report

```cf3
    Need to delete line - ... - but only a warning was promised
```

Instead of

```cf3
    Deleting the promised line ... Need to save file - but only a warning was promised
```

In either case, no changes will be made to the disk, but the messages
given by `cf-agent` will differ.   

#### ifelapsed

**Description:** The number of minutes before next allowed assessment of 
a promise is set using `ifelapsed`. This overrides the global settings. 
Promises which take a long time to verify should usually be protected 
with a long value for this parameter.

This serves as a resource 'spam' protection. A CFEngine check could 
easily run every 5 minutes provided resource intensive operations are 
not performed on every run. Using time classes such as `Hr12` is one 
part of this strategy; using `ifelapsed` is another, which is not tied 
to a specific time.   

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Default value:** control body value

**Example:**

```cf3
     #local
     
     body action example
     {
     ifelapsed   => "120";  # 2 hours
     expireafter => "240";  # 4 hours
     }
     
     # global
     
     body agent control
     {
     ifelapsed   => "180";  # 3 hours
     }
```

#### expireafter

**Description:** The Number of minutes before a repair action is interrupted 
and retried is set with `expireafter`. This is the locking time after which 
CFEngine will attempt to kill and restart its attempt to keep a promise.   

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Default value:** control body value

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action example
     {
     ifelapsed   => "120";  # 2 hours
     expireafter => "240";  # 4 hours
     }
```

#### log_string

**Description:** The message to be written to the log when a promise 
verification leads to a repair.

The `log_string` works together with `log_kept`, `log_repaired`, and 
`log_failed` to define a string for logging to one of the named files 
depending on promise outcome, or to standard output if the log file is 
stipulated as `stdout`. Log strings on standard output are denoted by an `L:` 
prefix.

Note that `log_string` does not interact with `log_level`, which is about 
regular system output messages.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
    promise-type:

     "promiser"

       attr = "value",
       action = log_me("checked $(this.promiser) in promise $(this.handle)");

    # ..

    body action log_me(s)
    {
    log_string = "$(s)";
    }
```

**Hint**: The promise handle [`$(this.handle)`][this#this.handle] can be a 
useful referent in a log message, indicating the origin of the message. In 
[CFEngine Enterprise][Enterprise Reporting], every promise has a default 
handle, which is based on the filename and line number (specifying your own 
handle will probably be more mnemonic).

#### log_kept
#### log_repaired
#### log_failed

**Description:** The names of files to which `log_string` will be saved
for kept, repaired and failed promises.

When used together with `log_string`, the current promise will log its status 
using the log string to the respective file.

If these log names are absent, the default logging destination for the log 
string is syslog, but only for non-kept promises. Only the `log_string` is 
affected by this setting. Other messages destined for logging are sent to 
syslog.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `stdout|udp_syslog|("?[a-zA-Z]:\\.*)|(/.*)`

This string should be the full path to a text file which will contain 
the log, or one of the following special values:

* `stdout`

Send the log message to the standard output, prefixed with an L: to indicate 
a log message.   

* `udp_syslog`

Attempt to connect to the `syslog_server` defined in body common control and 
log the message there, assuming the server is configured to receive the 
request.

**Example:**

```cf3
     bundle agent test
     {
     vars:
     
       "software" slist => { "/root/xyz", "/tmp/xyz" };
     
     files:
     
       "$(software)"
     
         create => "true",
          action => logme("$(software)");
     
     }
     
     body action logme(x)
     {
     log_kept => "/tmp/private_keptlog.log";
     log_failed => "/tmp/private_faillog.log";
     log_repaired => "/tmp/private_replog.log";
     log_string => "$(sys.date) $(x) promise status";
     }
     
     body action immediate_syslog(x) 
     {
     log_repaired => "udp_syslog";
     log_string => "CFEngine repaired promise $(this.handle) - $(x)";
     }
```

It is intended that named file logs should be different for the three cases: 
promise kept, promise not kept and promise repaired.

#### log_level

**Description:** Describes the reporting level sent to syslog.

Use this as an alternative to auditing if you wish to use the syslog mechanism 
to centralize or manage messaging from CFEngine. A backup of these messages 
will still be kept in `WORKDIR/outputs` if you are using `cf-execd`.

On the native Windows version of CFEngine Enterprise, using verbose 
will include a message when the promise is kept or repaired in the event 
log.   

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**   

```
    inform
    verbose
    error
    log
```

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action example
     {
     log_level => "inform";
     }
```

#### log_priority

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**   

```
    emergency
    alert
    critical
    error
    warning
    notice
    info
    debug
```

**Description:** The `log_priority` menu option policy is the priority level 
of the log message, as interpreted by a syslog server. It determines the 
importance of messages from CFEngine.   

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action low_priority
     {
     log_priority => "info";
     }
```

#### value_kept

**Description:** The value attributed to keeping this promise.

If nothing is specified, the default value is +1.0. However, nothing is logged 
unless the agent control body sets `track_value` to "true".

**Type:** `real`

**Allowed input range:** `-9.99999E100,9.99999E100`

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action mydef
     {
     value_kept     => "4.5";   # this promise is worth 4.5 dollars per hour
     value_repaired => "2.5";   # fixing this promise is worth 2.5 dollars per hour
     value_notkept  => "-10.0"; # not keeping this promise costs is 10 dollars per hour
     ifelapsed       => "60";   # one hour
     }
```

#### value_repaired

**Description:** The value attributed to repairing a promise.

If nothing is specified, the default value is 0.5. However, nothing is logged unless the agent control body set `track_value` to "true".

**Type:** `real`

**Allowed input range:** `-9.99999E100,9.99999E100`

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action mydef
     {
     value_kept     => "4.5";   # this promise is worth 4.5 dollars per hour
     value_repaired => "2.5";   # fixing this promise is worth 2.5 dollars per hour
     value_notkept  => "-10.0"; # not keeping this promise costs is 10 dollars per hour
     ifelapsed       => "60";   # one hour
     }
```

#### value_notkept

**Description:** The (possibly negative) value attributed to not keeping a 
promise.

If nothing is specified, the default value is -1.0. However, nothing is logged 
unless the agent control body sets `track_value` to "true".
  
**Type:** `real`

**Allowed input range:** `-9.99999E100,9.99999E100`

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action mydef
     {
     value_kept     => "4.5";   # this promise is worth 4.5 dollars per hour
     value_repaired => "2.5";   # fixing this promise is worth 2.5 dollars per hour
     value_notkept  => "-10.0"; # not keeping this promise costs is 10 dollars per hour
     ifelapsed       => "60";   # one hour
     }
```

#### audit

**Description:** A true/false switch for detailed audit records of a promise.

If this is set, CFEngine will perform auditing on this specific promise. This 
means that all details surrounding the verification of the current promise 
will be recorded in the audit database.   

**Type:** [`boolean`][boolean]

**Default value:** false

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action example
     {
     # ...
     
     audit => "true";
     }
```

#### background

**Description:** A true/false switch for parallelizing the promise repair.

If possible, perform the verification of the current promise in the 
background. This is advantageous only if the verification might take a 
significant amount of time, e.g. in remote copying of filesystem/disk scans.

On the Windows version of CFEngine Enterprise, this can be useful if we don't
want to wait for a particular command to finish execution before checking 
the next promise. This is particular for the Windows platform because there 
is no way that a program can start itself in the background here; in other 
words, fork off a child process. However, file operations can not be 
performed in the background on Windows.   

**Type:** [`boolean`][boolean]

**Default value:** false

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action example
     {
     background => "true";
     }
```

#### report_level

**Description:** Defines the reporting level for standard output for this promise.

`cf-agent` can be run in verbose mode (-v), inform mode (-I) and just print 
errors (no arguments). This attribute allows to set these three output levels 
on a per promise basis, allowing the promise to be more verbose than the 
global setting (but not less).

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**   

```
    inform
    verbose
    error
    log
```

**Default value:** none

**Example:**

```cf3
     body action example
     {
     report_level => "verbose";
     }
```

#### measurement_class

**Description:** If set, performance will be measured and recorded under this 
identifier.

By setting this string you switch on performance measurement for the current 
promise, and also give the measurement a name. 

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     body action measure
     {
     measurement_class => "$(this.promiser) long job scan of /usr";
     }
```

The identifier forms a partial identity for optional performance scanning of promises of the form:

```cf3
    ID:promise-type:promiser.
```


### classes

**Type:** `body classes`

#### scope

**Description:** Scope of the class set by this body.

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**

```
    namespace
    bundle
```

**Default value:** namespace

**Example:**

```cf3
    body classes bundle_class
    {
      scope => "bundle";
      promise_kept => { "bundle_context" };
    }
```

**History:** This attribute was introduced in CFEngine 3.5

**See also:** [`scope` in `classes` promises][classes#scope]

#### promise_repaired

**Description:** Classes to be defined globally if the promise was 'repaired'.

If the classes are set, a corrective action had to be taken to keep the 
promise.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     promise_repaired => { "change_happened" };
     }
```

**Important**: Complex promises can report misleadingly; for example, 
`files` promises that set multiple parameters on a file simultaneously.

The classes for different parts of a promise are not separable. Thus, if 
you promise to create and file and change its permissions, when the file 
exists with incorrect permissions, `cf-agent` will report that the 
`promise_kept` for the file existence, but `promise_repaired` for the 
permissions. If you need separate reports, you should code two separate 
promises rather than 'overloading' a single one.   


#### repair_failed

**Description:** Classes to be defined globally if the promise could not be 
kept.

If the classes are set, the corrective action to keep the promise failed for 
some reason.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so it 
is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.   

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     repair_failed => { "unknown_error" };
     }
```

#### repair_denied

**Description:** Classes to be defined globally if the promise could not be 
repaired due to denied access to required resources.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     repair_denied => { "permission_failure" };
     }
```

In the above example, a promise could not be kept because access to a key 
resource was denied. 


#### repair_timeout

**Description:** Classes to be defined globally if the promise could not be 
repaired due to timeout.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     repair_timeout => { "too_slow", "did_not_wait" };
     }
``` 

In the above example, a promise maintenance repair timed-out waiting for some dependent resource.   

#### promise_kept

**Description:** Classes to be defined globally if the promise was kept 
without any corrective action.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     promise_kept => { "success", "kaplah" };
     }
```

The class in the above example is set if no action was necessary by 
`cf-agent`, because the promise concerned was already kept without further 
action required.

**Note**: Complex promises can report misleadingly. For example, 
`files`promises that set multiple parameters on a file simultaneously.

The classes for different parts of a promise are not separable. Thus, 
if you promise to create and file and change its permissions, when the 
file exists with incorrect permissions, `cf-agent` will report that the 
`promise_kept` for the file existence, but `promise_repaired` for the 
permissions. If you need separate reports, you should code two separate 
promises rather than 'overloading' a single one.

#### cancel_kept

**Description:** Classes to be canceled if the promise is kept.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     cancel_kept => { "success", "kaplah" };
     }
```

In the above example, if the promise was already kept and nothing was done, 
cancel (undefine) any of the listed classes so that they are no longer 
defined.

**History:** This attribute was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4 (2010)   

#### cancel_repaired

**Description:** Classes to be canceled if the promise is repaired.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     cancel_repaired => { "change_happened" };
     }
```

In the above example, if the promise was repaired and changes were made to 
the system, cancel (undefine) any of the listed classes so that they are 
no longer defined.

**History:** This attribute was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4 (2010)   

#### cancel_notkept

**Description:** Classes to be canceled if the promise is not kept for any 
reason.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

Note that any strings passed to this list are automatically canonified, so 
it is unnecessary to call a canonify function on such inputs.

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     cancel_notkept => { "failure" };
     }
```

In the above example, if the promise was not kept but nothing could be done, 
cancel (undefine) any of the listed classes so that they are no longer 
defined.

**History:** This attribute was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4 (2010)   

#### kept_returncodes

**Description:** Return codes that indicate a kept `commands` promise.

Currently, the attribute has impact on the following command-related 
promises:

* All promises of type `commands:`
* `files`-promises containing a `transformer`-attribute
* The package manager change command in `packages`-promises (e.g. the 
command for add, remove, etc.)

If none of the attributes `kept_returncodes`, `repaired_returncodes`, or 
`failed_returncodes` are set, the default is to consider a return code 
zero as promise repaired, and nonzero as promise failed.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[-0-9_$(){}\[\].]+`

Note that the return codes may overlap, so multiple classes may be set 
from one return code. In Unix systems the possible return codes are 
usually in the range from 0 to 255.

**Example:**

```cf3
     bundle agent cmdtest
     {
     commands:
       "/bin/false"
        classes => example;
     
     reports:
       waskept::
         "The command-promise was kept!";
     }
     
     body classes example
     {
     kept_returncodes => { "0", "1" };
     promise_kept => { "waskept" };
     }
```

In the above example, a list of integer return codes indicates that a 
command-related promise has been kept. This can in turn be used to define 
classes using the `promise_kept` attribute, or merely alter the total 
compliance statistics.

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.1.3, Nova 2.0.2 (2010)   

#### repaired_returncodes

**Description:** Return codes that indicate a repaired `commands` promise

Currently, the attribute has impact on the following command-related 
promises:

* All promises of type `commands:`
* `files`-promises containing a `transformer`-attribute
* The package manager change command in `packages`-promises (e.g. the 
command for add, remove, etc.)

If none of the attributes `kept_returncodes`, `repaired_returncodes`, or 
`failed_returncodes` are set, the default is to consider a return code 
zero as promise repaired, and nonzero as promise failed.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[-0-9_$(){}\[\].]+`

Note that the return codes may overlap, so multiple classes may be set 
from one return code. In Unix systems the possible return codes are usually 
in the range from 0 to 255.

**Example:**  
   
```cf3
     bundle agent cmdtest
     {
     commands:
       "/bin/false"
        classes => example;
     
     reports:
       wasrepaired::
         "The command-promise got repaired!";
     }
     
     body classes example
     {
     repaired_returncodes => { "0", "1" };
     promise_repaired => { "wasrepaired" }; 
     }
```

In the above example, a list of integer return codes indicating that a 
command-related promise has been repaired. This can in turn be used to 
define classes using the `promise_repaired` attribute, or merely alter the total compliance statistics.

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.1.3, Nova 2.0.2 (2010)   

#### failed_returncodes

**Description:** A `failed_returncodes` slist contains return codes 
indicating a failed command-related promise.

Currently, the attribute has impact on the following command-related 
promises:

* All promises of type `commands:`
* `files`-promises containing a `transformer`-attribute
* The package manager change command in `packages`-promises (e.g. the 
command for add, remove, etc.)

If none of the attributes `kept_returncodes`, `repaired_returncodes`, or 
`failed_returncodes` are set, the default is to consider a return code 
zero as promise repaired, and nonzero as promise failed.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** `[-0-9_$(){}\[\].]+`

Note that the return codes may overlap, so multiple classes may be set 
from one return code. In Unix systems the possible return codes are usually 
in the range from 0 to 255.

**Example:**

```cf3
     body common control
     {
     bundlesequence => { "cmdtest" };
     }
     
     bundle agent cmdtest
     {
     files:
     "/tmp/test"
       copy_from => copy("/etc/passwd");
     
     
     "/tmp/test"
       classes => example,
       transformer => "/bin/grep -q lkajfo999999 $(this.promiser)";
     
     reports:
       hasfailed::
         "The files-promise failed!";
     }
     
     body classes example
     {
     failed_returncodes => { "1" };
     repair_failed => { "hasfailed" };
     }
     
     body copy_from copy(file)
     {
     source => "$(file)";
     } 
```

The above example contains a list of integer return codes indicating 
that a command-related promise has failed. This can in turn be used to 
define classes using the `promise_repaired` attribute, or merely alter 
the total compliance statistics.

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.1.3, Nova 2.0.2 (2010)   

#### persist_time

**Description:** The number of minutes the specified classes should remain 
active.

By default classes are ephemeral entities that disappear when `cf-agent` 
terminates. By setting a persistence time, they can last even when the agent 
is not running.

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     persist_time => "10";
     }
```

#### timer_policy

**Description:** Determines whether a persistent class restarts its counter 
when rediscovered.

In most cases resetting a timer will give a more honest appraisal of which 
classes are currently important, but if we want to activate a response of 
limited duration as a rare event then an absolute time limit is useful.

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**   

```
    absolute
    reset
```

**Default value:** reset

**Example:**

```cf3
     body classes example
     {
     timer_policy => "reset";
     }
```

### comment

**Description:** Describes the real intention of the promise.

Comments written in code follow the program, they are not merely discarded; 
they appear in reports and error messages.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
    comment => "This comment follows the data for reference ...",
```

### depends_on

**Description:** Promise handles that this promise builds on or depends on 
somehow.

This is a list of promise handles for whom this promise is a promisee. In 
other words, we acknowledge that this promise will be affected by the list of 
promises whose handles are specified. It has the effect of partially ordering 
promises.

As of version 3.4.0, this feature may be considered short-hand for setting 
classes. If one promise depends on a list of others, it will not be verified 
unless the dependent promises have already been verified and kept: in other 
words, as long as the dependent promises are either kept or repaired the 
dependee can be verified.

Handles in other namespaces may be referred to by namespace:handle.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
    bundle agent one
    {
    reports:
       "two"
         depends_on => { "handle_one" };

       "one"
         handle => "handle_one";
    }
```

### handle

**Description:** A unique id-tag string for referring to this as a promisee 
elsewhere.

A promise handle allows you to refer to a promise as the promisee of 
`depends_on` client of another promise. Handles are essential for mapping 
dependencies and performing impact analyses.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

Handles may consist of regular identifier characters. CFEngine automatically 
`canonifies' the names of handles to conform to this standard.

**Example:**

```cf3
access:
 
  "/source"

    handle  => "update_rule",
    admit   => { "127.0.0.1" };
```

**Notes:** If the handle name is based on a variable, and the variable
fails to expand, the handle will be based on the name of the variable
rather than its content.

### ifvarclass

**Description:** Describes extended classes ANDed with context.

This is an additional class expression that will be evaluated after the 
`class::` classes have selected promises. It is provided in order to enable a 
channel between variables and classes.

The result is thus the logical AND of the ordinary classes and the variable 
classes.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

The generic example has the form:

```cf3
     promise-type:
     
       "promiser"
     
         ifvarclass = "$(program)_running|($(program)_notfoundHr12)";
```

A specific example would be:

```cf3
    bundle agent example
    {     
    commands:

     any::

        "/bin/echo This is linux"

           ifvarclass => "linux";

        "/bin/echo This is solaris"

           ifvarclass => "solaris";
    }
```

This function is provided so that one can form expressions that link 
variables and classes. For example:

```cf3
    # Check that all components are running

    vars:

      "component" slist => { "cf-monitord", "cf-serverd" };

    processes:

      "$(component)" restart_class => canonify("start_$(component)");

    commands:

       "/var/cfengine/bin/$(component)"

           ifvarclass => canonify("start_$(component)");
```

Notice that the function `canonify()` is provided to convert a general 
variable input into a string composed only of legal characters, using the same 
algorithm that CFEngine uses.

### meta

**Description:** User-data associated with policy, e.g. key=value strings.

It is sometimes convenient to attach meta-data of a more technical nature to 
policy. It may be used for arbitrary key=value strings for example.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
files:

  "/etc/special_file"

    comment => "Special file is a requirement. Talk to Fred X.",
    create => "true",

    meta => { "owner=John",  "version=2.0" };
```

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Nova 2.2.0 (2012)
