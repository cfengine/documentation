[Variables][variables] in CFEngine are defined
as promises that an identifier of a certain type represents a particular
value. Variables can be scalars or lists of types `string`, `int`, `real`
or `data`.

The allowed characters in variable names are alphanumeric (both upper and lower case)
and undercore. `Associative` arrays using the string type and square brackets `[]` to
enclose an arbitrary key are being deprecated in favor of the `data` variable type.

## Scalar Variables

### string

**Description:** A scalar string

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**


```cf3
    vars:

     "xxx"    string => "Some literal string...";
     "yyy"    string => readfile( "/home/mark/tmp/testfile" , "33" );
```

### int

**Description:** A scalar integer

**Type:** `int`

**Allowed input range:** `-99999999999,9999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

     "scalar" int    => "16k";
     "ran"    int    => randomint(4,88);
     "dim_array" int =>  readstringarray(
         "array_name",
         "/etc/passwd",
         "#[^\n]*",
         ":",
         10,
         4000);
```

**Notes:**

Int variables are strings that are expected to be used as integer numbers. The
typing in CFEngine is dynamic, so the variable types are interchangeable.
However, when you declare a variable to be type `int`, CFEngine verifies that
the value you assign to it looks like an integer (e.g., 3, -17, 16K).

### real

**Description:** A scalar real number

**Type:** `real`

**Allowed input range:** `-9.99999E100,9.99999E100`

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

     "scalar" real   => "0.5";
```

**Notes:**

Real variables are strings that are expected to be used as real numbers. The
typing in CFEngine is dynamic, so the variable types are interchangeable, but
when you declare a variable to be type `real`, CFEngine verifies that the
value you assign to it looks like a real number (e.g., 3, 3.1415, .17,
6.02e23, -9.21e-17).

Real numbers are not used in many places in CFEngine, but they are useful for
representing probabilities and performance data.

## List variables

Lists are specified using curly brackets `{}` that enclose a comma-separated
list of values. The order of the list is preserved by CFEngine.

### slist

**Description:** A list of scalar strings

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

     "xxx"    slist  => {  "literal1",  "literal2" };
     "xxx1"   slist  => {  "1", @(xxx) }; # interpolated in order
     "yyy"    slist  => {
                        readstringlist(
                                      "/home/mark/tmp/testlist",
                                      "#[a-zA-Z0-9 ]*",
                                      "[^a-zA-Z0-9]",
                                      15,
                                      4000
                                      )
                        };

     "zzz"    slist  => { readstringlist(
        "/home/mark/tmp/testlist2",
        "#[^\n]*",
        ",",
        5,
        4000)
        };
```

**Notes:**

Some [functions][Functions] return `slist`s, and an `slist`
may contain the values copied from another `slist`, `rlist`, or `ilist`. See
[`policy`](#policy).

### ilist

**Description:** A list of integers

**Type:** `ilist`

**Allowed input range:** `-99999999999,9999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

      "variable_id"

           ilist => { "10", "11", "12" };

      "xxx1" ilist  => {  "1", @(variable_id) }; # interpolated in order
```

**Notes:**

Integer lists are lists of strings that are expected to be treated as
integers. The typing in CFEngine is dynamic, so the variable types are
interchangeable, but when you declare a variable to be type `ilist`,
CFEngine verifies that each value you assign to it looks like an integer
(e.g., 3, -17, 16K).

Some [functions][Functions] return `ilist`s, and an `ilist` may
contain the values copied from another `slist`, `rlist`, or `ilist`. See
[`policy`](#policy)

### rlist

**Description:** A list of real numbers

**Type:** `rlist`

**Allowed input range:** `-9.99999E100,9.99999E100`

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

      "varid" rlist => { "0.1", "0.2", "0.3" };

      "xxx1" rlist  => {  "1.3", @(varid) }; # interpolated in order
```

**Notes:**

Real lists are lists of strings that are expected to be used as real
numbers. The typing in CFEngine is dynamic, so the variable types are
interchangeable, but when you declare a variable to be type `rlist`,
CFEngine verifies that each value you assign to it looks like a real
number (e.g., 3, 3.1415, .17, 6.02e23, -9.21e-17).

Some [functions][Functions] return `rlist`s, and an `rlist` may
contain the values copied from another `slist`, `rlist`, or `ilist`. See [`policy`](#policy)

## Data container variables

The `data` variables are obtained from functions that return data
containers, such as `readjson()`, `readyaml()`, `parsejson()`, or
`parseyaml()`, the various `data_*` functions, or from merging
existing data containers with `mergedata()`. They can *NOT* be
modified, once created.

### Inline YAML and JSON data

Data containers can be specified inline, without calling functions.
For example:

```cf3
    vars:
      # JSON or YAML can be inlined since CFEngine 3.7
      "inline1" data => '{"key":"value"}'; # JSON
      "inline2" data => '---\n- key2: value2'; # YAML requires "---\n" header
```

Inline YAML data has to begin with the `---\n` preamble. This preamble
is normally optional but here (for inline YAML) it's required by
CFEngine.

Inline JSON or YAML data may contain CFEngine variable references.
They will be expanded at runtime as if they were simply calls to
`readjson()` or `readyaml()`, which also means that syntax error in
the JSON or YAML data will only be caught when your policy is actually
being evaluated.

If the inline JSON or YAML data does **not** contain CFEngine variable
references, it will be parsed at compile time, which means that
`cf-promises` will be able to find syntax errors in your JSON or YAML
data early. Thus it is highly recommended that you try to avoid
variable references in your inline JSON or YAML data.

### Passing data containers to bundles

Data containers can be passed to another bundle with the
`@(varname)` notation, similarly to the list passing notation.

### Some useful tips for using data containers

* to extract just `container[x]`, use `mergedata("container[x]")`
* to wrap a container in an array, use `mergedata("[ container ]")`
* to wrap a container in a map, use `mergedata('{ "mykey": container }')`
* they act like "classic" CFEngine arrays in many ways
* `getindices()` and `getvalues()` work on any level, e.g. `getvalues("container[x][y]")`
* in reports, you have to reference a part of the container that can be expressed as a string.  So for instance if you have the container `c` with data `{ "x": { "y": 50 }, "z": [ 1,2,3] }` we have two top-level keys, `x` and `z`.  If you report on `$(c[x])` you will not get data, since there is no string there.  But if you ask for `$(c[x][y])` you'll get `50`, and if you ask for `$(c[z])` you'll get implicit iteration on `1,2,3` (just like a slist in a "classic" CFEngine array).
* read the examples below carefully to see some useful ways to access data container contents

Iterating through a data container is only guaranteed to respect list
order (e.g. `[1,3,20]` will be iterated in that order). Key order for
maps, as per the JSON standard, is not guaranteed. Similarly, calling
`getindices()` on a data container will give the list order of indices
0, 1, 2, ... but will not give the keys of a map in any particular
order.  Here's an example of iterating in list order:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(container_iteration.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(container_iteration.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

Often you need to iterate through the keys of a container, and the
value is a key-value property map for that key. The example here shows
how you can pass the "animals" container and an "animal" key inside it
to a bundle, which can then report and use the data from the key-value
property map.

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(container_key_iteration.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(container_key_iteration.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

### data

**Description:** A data container structure

**Type:** `data`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

     "loaded1" data => readjson("/tmp/myfile.json", 40000);
     "loaded2" data => parsejson('{"key":"value"}');
     "loaded3" data => readyaml("/tmp/myfile.yaml", 40000);
     "loaded4" data => parseyaml('- key2: value2');
     "merged1" data => mergedata(loaded1, loaded2, loaded3, loaded4);

     # JSON or YAML can be inlined since CFEngine 3.7
     "inline1" data => '{"key":"value"}'; # JSON
     "inline2" data => '---\n- key2: value2'; # YAML requires "---\n" header

```

### policy

**Description:** The policy for (dis)allowing (re)definition of variables

Variables can either be allowed to change their value dynamically (be
redefined) or they can be constant.

**Type:** (menu option)

**Allowed input range:**

```
    free
    overridable
    constant
    ifdefined
```

**Default value:**

`policy = free`

**Example:**

```cf3
    vars:

      "varid" string => "value...",
              policy => "free";
```

**Notes:**

The policy `free` and `overridable` are synonyms.  The policy `constant` is
deprecated, and has no effect. All variables are `free` or `overridable` by
default which means the variables values may be changed.

The policy `ifdefined` applies only to lists and implies that unexpanded or
undefined lists are dropped. The default behavior is otherwise to retain this
value as an indicator of the failure to quench the variable reference, for
example:

```cf3
    "one" slist => { "1", "2", "3" };

    "list" slist => { "@(one)", @(two) },
          policy => "ifdefined";
```

This results in `@(list)` being the same as `@(one)`, and the reference to
`@(two)` disappears. This is useful for combining lists.

For example:

```cf3
example_com::
  "domain"
     string => "example.com",
    comment => "Define a global domain for hosts in the example.com domain";

# The promise above will be overridden by one of the ones below on hosts
# within the matching subdomain

one_example_com::
  "domain"
     string => "one.example.com",
    comment => "Define a global domain for hosts in the one.example.com domain";

two_example_com::
  "domain"
     string => "two.example.com",
    comment => "Define a global domain for hosts in the two.example.com domain";
```

(Promises within the same bundle are evaluated top to bottom, so vars promises further down in a bundle can overwrite previous values of a variable. See [**normal ordering**][Normal Ordering] for more information).
