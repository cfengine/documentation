This promise type assures that an attribute, with the given name and value, will
be present in the specified node within the XML file. If the attribute is not
found, the default promise is to insert the attribute, into the specified node.
If the attribute is already present, the default promise is to insure that the
attribute value is set to the given value. The specified node and attribute
value are each determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred to is
a literal string representation of the name of the attribute to be set.

```cf3
bundle edit_xml example
{
set_attribute:
  "name"

    attribute_value => "cfe_host",
       select_xpath => "/Server/Service/Engine/Host";
}
```

Note that typically only a single attribute, within a single selected
node, is set in each `set_attribute` promise. You may of course have
multiple promises that each set an attribute.
