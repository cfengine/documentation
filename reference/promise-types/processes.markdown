Process promises refer to items in the system process table, i.e., a command in
some state of execution (with a Process Control Block). Promiser objects are
patterns that are [unanchored][unanchored], meaning that they match parts of
command lines in the system process table.

```cf3
processes:

  "regex contained in process line"

      process_select = process_filter_body,
      restart_class = "activation class for process",
      ..;
```

**Note**: CFEngine uses the output from the `ps` command to inspect running
processes, and these formats differ between platforms. You can see how cfengine
views the process table for your platform by inspecting `cf_otherprocs`,
`cf_procs`, and `cf_rootprocs` which can be found in `$(sys.workdir)/state/`
(typically `/var/cfengine/state`).

This is an example showing how to restart a splunk process owned by root:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  processes:
      "splunkd"
        process_select => by_owner( "root" ),
        handle => "example_splunk_stop_gracefully",
        process_stop => "/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk stop",
        comment => "Find splunkd processes owned by root. Stop it gracefully
                    with the internal splunk binary.";

      "splunkd"
        restart_class => "splunk_not_running",
        comment => "Set splunk_not_running class if we cant find any root owned
		    splunkd processes so that we can restart it using a
                    commands promise";

  commands:
    splunk_not_running::
      "/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk"
        args => "--accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt start";
}
```

This example shows using `process_select` and `process_count` to define a class
when a process has been running for longer than a day.

[%CFEngine_include_example(processes_define_class_based_on_process_runtime.cf)%]

Take care to not oversimplify your patterns as it may match
unexpected processes. For example, on many systems, the process pattern `"^cp"`
may not match any processes, even though `"cp"` is running. This is because the
process table entry may list `"/bin/cp"`. However, the process pattern `"cp"`
will also match a process containing `"scp"`, (the PCRE pattern anchors `"\b"`
and `"\B"` may prove very useful to you).

`process_stop` should only be used for commands that stop processes. To start or
restart a process, you should set a class to activate and then use a `commands`
promise together with that class.

```cf3
processes:
    "/path/executable"
      restart_class => "restart_me";

commands:
  restart_me::
   "/path/executable" ... ;
```

**Notes:**

* CFEngine will not allow you to signal processes 1-4 or the agent process
  itself for fear of bringing down the system.


* Process promises depend on the `ps` native tool, which by default truncates
  lines at 128 columns on HP-UX. It is recommended to edit the file
  `/etc/default/ps` and increase the `DEFAULT_CMD_LINE_WIDTH` setting to 1024 to
  guarantee that process promises will work smoothly on that platform.

## Attributes ##

[%CFEngine_include_markdown(common-attributes-include.markdown)%]

### process_count

**Type:** `body process_count`

**See also:** [Common Body Attributes][Promise Types#Common Body Attributes]

#### in_range_define

**Description:** List of classes to define if the matches are in range

Classes are defined if the processes that are found in the process table
satisfy the promised process count, in other words if the promise about
the number of processes matching the other criteria is kept.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_count example
{
in_range_define => { "class1", "class2" };
}
```

#### match_range

**Description:** Integer range for acceptable number of matches for this
process

This is a numerical range for the number of occurrences of the process
in the process table. As long as it falls within the specified limits,
the promise is considered kept.

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_count example
{
match_range => irange("10","50");
}
```

#### out_of_range_define

**Description:** List of classes to define if the matches are out of range

Classes to activate remedial promises conditional on this promise
failure to be kept.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_count example(s)
{
out_of_range_define => { "process_anomaly", "anomaly_$(s)"};
}
```

### process_select

**Type:** `body process_select`

**See also:** [Common Body Attributes][Promise Types#Common Body Attributes]

#### command

**Description:** Regular expression matching the command/cmd field of a
process

**Note:** For historical reasons, this attribute is identical to the match
performed by using the promiser, except that the regular expression is anchored.

This expression should match the entire `COMMAND` field of the process
table, not just a fragment. This field is usually the last field on the
line, so it thus starts with the first non-space character and ends with
the end of line.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example

{
command => "cf-.*";

process_result => "command";
}
```

#### pid

**Description:** Range of integers matching the process id of a process

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
pid => irange("1","10");
process_result => "pid";
}
```

#### pgid

**Description:** Range of integers matching the parent group id of a
process

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
pgid => irange("1","10");
process_result => "pgid";

```cf3
body process_select example
{
ppid => irange("407","511");
process_result => "ppid";
}
```

#### priority

**Description:** Range of integers matching the priority field (PRI/NI) of
a process

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `-20,+20`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
priority => irange("-5","0");
}
```

#### process_owner

**Description:** List of regexes matching the user of a process

The regular expressions should match a legal user name on the system. The
regex is [anchored][anchored], meaning it must match the entire name.

**Type:** `slist`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_example(kill_process_running_wrong_user.cf)%]

#### process_result

**Description:** Boolean class expression with the logical combination
of process selection criteria

A logical combination of the process selection classifiers. The syntax
is the same as that for class expressions. If `process_result` is not
specified, then all set attributes in the `process_select` body are AND'ed
together.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:**
`[(process_owner|pid|ppid||pgid|rsize|vsize|status|command|ttime|stime|tty|priority|threads)[|!.]*]*`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select proc_finder(p)

{
process_owner  => { "avahi", "bin" };
command        => "$(p)";
pid            => irange("100","199");
vsize          => irange("0","1000");
process_result => "command.(process_owner|vsize).!pid";
}
```

**See also:** `file_result`

#### rsize

**Description:** Range of integers matching the resident memory size of a
process, in kilobytes

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select
{
rsize => irange("4000","8000");
}
```

#### status

**Description:** Regular expression matching the status field of a process

For instance, characters in the set `NRSsl+..`. Windows processes do not
have status fields.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
status => "Z";
}
```

#### stime_range

**Description:** Range of integers matching the start time of a process

The calculation of time from process table entries is sensitive to
Daylight Savings Time (Summer/Winter Time) so calculations could be an
hour off. This is for now a bug to be fixed.

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,2147483647`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
stime_range => irange(ago(0,0,0,1,0,0),now);
}
```

**Description:** Range of integers matching the total elapsed time of a
process.

This is total accumulated time for a process.

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,2147483647`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
ttime_range => irange(0,accumulated(0,1,0,0,0,0));
}
```

#### tty

**Description:** Regular expression matching the tty field of a process

Windows processes are not regarded as attached to any terminal, so they
all have tty '?'.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** (arbitrary string)

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
tty => "pts/[0-9]+";
}
```

#### threads

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
threads => irange(1,5);
}
```

#### vsize

**Description:** Range of integers matching the virtual memory size of a
process, in kilobytes.

On Windows, the virtual memory size is the amount of memory that cannot
be shared with other processes. In Task Manager, this is called Commit
Size (Windows 2008), or VM Size (Windows XP).

**Type:** `irange[int,int]`

**Allowed input range:** `0,99999999999`

**Example:**

```cf3
body process_select example
{
vsize => irange("4000","9000");
}
```

### process_stop

**Description:** A command used to stop a running process

As an alternative to sending a termination or kill signal to a process,
one may call a 'stop script' to perform a graceful shutdown.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `"?(/.*)`

**Example:**

```cf3
processes:

 "snmpd"

        process_stop => "/etc/init.d/snmp stop";
```


### restart_class

**Description:** A class to be defined globally if the process is not
running, so that a `command:` rule can be referred to restart the process

This is a signal to restart a process that should be running, if it is
not running. Processes are signaled first and then restarted later, at
the end of bundle execution, after all possible corrective actions have
been made that could influence their execution.

Windows does not support having processes start themselves in the
background, like Unix daemons usually do; as fork off a child process.
Therefore, it may be useful to specify an `action` body that sets
`background` to true in a commands promise that is invoked by the class
set by `restart_class`. See the `commands` promise type for more
information.

**Type:** `string`

**Allowed input range:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_$(){}\[\].:]+`

**Example:**

```cf3
processes:

   "cf-serverd"

     restart_class => "start_cfserverd";

commands:

  start_cfserverd::

    "/var/cfengine/bin/cf-serverd";
```

### signals

**Description:** A list of names of signals to be sent to a process or sleeps
between signals.

Signals from the given list are sent to the process in a sequence. Special
strings of the form `Ns` or just `N` where `N` is a positive integer can be used
to add sleeps between the signals. On Windows, only the kill signal is
supported, which terminates the process.

**Type:** (`slist`)

**Allowed input range:**

```cf3
hup
int
trap
kill
pipe
cont
abrt
stop
quit
term
child
usr1
usr2
bus
segv
[0-9]+s?
```

**Example:**

```cf3
processes:

 cfservd_out_of_control::

   "cfservd"

        signals         => { "stop" , "term" },
        restart_class   => "start_cfserv";

 any::

   "snmpd"

        signals         => { "term" , "5s" , "kill" };
```

**History:**

* 3.18.2, 3.20.0 Added ability to sleep between signals using `Ns`
