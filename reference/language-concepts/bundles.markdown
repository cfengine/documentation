A bundle is a collection of promises. They allow to group related promises
together into named building blocks that can be thought of as "subroutines" in
the CFEngine promise language. A bundle that groups a number of promises
related to configuring a web server or a file system would be named
"webserver" or "filesystem," respectively.

**NOTE**: Bundles **are not functions**. They maintain state across actuations
within the same agent run.

* Classic arrays are cleared at the beginning of a bundle actuation.
* Lists, strings, ints, reals, and data-containers are preserved but can be
  re-defined if not guarded with ```if => isvariable()```.
* `bundle` scoped classes are cleared at the end of the bundles execution
* `namespace` scoped classes are not cleared automatically, though they can be
  explicitly undefined.

Most promise types are specific to a particular kind of interpretation that
requires a typed interpreter - the bundle *type*. Bundles belong to the agent
that is used to keep the promises in the bundle. So `cf-agent` has bundles
declared as:

```cf3
bundle agent my_name
{
}
```

while `cf-serverd` has bundles declared as:

```cf3
bundle server my_name
{
}
```

and `cf-monitord` has bundles declared as

```cf3
bundle monitor my_name
{
}
```

A number of promises can be made in any kind of bundle since they are of a
generic input/output nature. These are `vars`, [`classes`][classes], `defaults`,
[`meta`][meta] and `reports` promises.

### Common Bundles

Bundles of type `common` may only contain the promise types that are common to
all bodies. Their main function is to define cross-component global
definitions.

```cf3
bundle common globals
{
vars:

  "global_var" string => "value";

classes:

  "global_class" expression => "value";
}
```

Common bundles are observed by every agent, whereas the agent
specific bundle types are ignored by components other than the intended
recipient.

#### Rules for evaluation of common bundles

These are the specific evaluation differences between common and agent bundles:

* common bundles are automatically evaluated even if they are not in the bundlesequence, as long as they have no parameters
* auto-evaluated common bundles (not in the bundlesequence explicitly) don't evaluate their `reports` promises, so their reports won't be printed.
* when common bundles define a class, it's global ([`scope`][classes#scope] is `namespace`) by default; the classes in agent bundles are local ([`scope`][classes#scope] is `bundle`) by default.
* common bundles can only contain [`meta`][meta], `default`, `vars`, [`classes`][classes], and `reports` promises

### Bundle Parameters

Bundles can be parameterized, allowing for code re-use. If you need to do the
same thing over and over again with slight variations, using a promise bundle
is an easy way to avoid unnecessary duplication in your promises.

```
bundle agent hello_world
{
  vars:
      "myfiles"     => "/tmp/world.txt";
      "desired_content" string => "hello";
      "userinfo" data => parsejson('{ "mark": 10, "jeang":20, "jonhenrik":30, "thomas":40, "eben":-1 }');

  methods:
      "Hello World"
        usebundle => ensure_file_has_content("$(myfiles)", "$(desired_content)");

      "report" usebundle => subtest_c(@(userinfo));

}

bundle agent ensure_file_has_content(file, content)
{
  files:

      "$(file)"
        handle => "$(this.bundle)_file_content",
        create => "true",
        edit_defaults => empty,
        edit_line => append_if_no_line("$(content)"),
        comment => "Ensure that the given parameter for file '$(file)' has only
                    the contents of the given parameter for content '$(content)'";

}

bundle agent subtest_c(info)
{
  reports:
   "user ID of mark is $(info[mark])";
}
```

You can pass `slist` and `data` variables to other bundles with
the `@(var)` notation.  You do NOT need to qualify the variable name
with the current bundle name.

### Scope

All [variables][variables] in CFEngine are globally accessible. If you
refer to a variable by '$(unqualified)', then it is assumed to belong
to the current bundle. To access any other (scalar) variable, you must
qualify the name, using the name of the bundle in which it is defined:

    $(bundle_name.qualified)

The value of the variable depends on evaluation order, which is not
controllable by the user. Thus you should not assume that you can
evaluate a bundle twice with different variables and get variables
from it that correspond to the second evaluation.  In other words, if you have:

```cf3
bundle agent mybundle(x)
{
  vars:
  "y" string => $(x);
}
```

and call `mybundle(1)` and `mybundle(2)`, the variable `y` could be `1` or `2`.

By default [classes][classes and decisions] defined by `classes` type promises
inside `agent` bundles are not visible outside those bundles, they are `bundle`
scoped. [Classes][classes and decisions] defined by `classes` type promises in
`common` bundles have a `namespace` scope, so they are visible everywhere.

Note that namespaced bundles work exactly the same way as
non-namespaced bundles (which are actually in the `default`
namespace).  You just say `namespace:bundle_name` instead of
`bundle_name`.  See [Namespaces] for more details.

### Main bundles and bundlesequence

When running `cf-agent`, the order of bundles to evaluate is determined by the `bundlesequence`.
The default `bundlesequence` contains `main` for convenience, so this example works:
[%CFEngine_include_example(main.cf)%]

#### Custom bundle sequences
You can specify a custom `bundlesequence` from the command line using `--bundlesequence`, or in policy:
[%CFEngine_include_example(bundlesequence.cf)%]

In this example, cf-agent will not look for a `main` bundle, since it is not in the `bundlesequence`.

#### Library main bundles

Bundles must be unique within a namespace, so you cannot have `main` bundles in different files which include each other.
Because of this, bundles which are called `__main__` have special behavior.
If the entry point (the file specified at command line) has a `__main__` bundle, it will be the `main` bundle.
`__main__` bundles from all other files will be ignored (removed before evaluation).

This is especially useful when writing libraries.
Each file can include its own testsuite or some default behavior in a `__main__` bundle.
All parts of the library will then be runnable directly, but also easy to include from other policy:

`main_library.cf`:
[%CFEngine_include_example(main_library.cf)%]

`main_entry_point.cf`:
[%CFEngine_include_example(main_entry_point.cf)%]

Both of these policy files can be run directly, the included library policy will not have a `main` bundle.
