An augments file can be used to define variables and classes to the execution of
**all** CFEngine components **before** any parsing or evaluation happen. It's a
JSON data file, so you should view and edit it with a JSON-aware editor if
possible.This is a convenient way to override defaults defined in the
Masterfiles Policy Framework without modifying the shipped policy itself.

The file `def.json` is found like the policy file to be run:

* with no arguments, it's in `$(sys.inputdir)/def.json` because
  `$(sys.inputdir)/promises.cf` is used
* with `-f /dirname/myfile.cf`, it's in `/dirname/def.json`
* with `-f myfile.cf`, it's in `./def.json`

Values will be expanded, so you can use the variables from
[Special Variables][].

Currently the augments file can contain three keys:

* `inputs`: any filenames you put here will appear in the `def.augments_inputs`
  variable. The standard set of masterfiles refers to this variable and will
  autoload those files.

* `vars`: any variables you put here will be put in the `def` scope. Thus:

  ```
"vars":
{
  "phone": "22-333-4444",
  "myplatform": "$(sys.os)",
}
  ```

  results in the variable `def.phone` with value `22-333-4444` being defined,
  and `def.myplatform` with the value of your current OS. Again, note that this
  happens before policy is parsed or evaluated.

  You can see the list of variables thus defined in the output of `cf-promises
  --show-vars` (see [Components and Common Control][]). They will be tagged with
  the tag `source=augments_file`. For instance, the above two variables
  (assuming you placed the data in `$(sys.inputdir)/def.json`) result in

  ```
cf-promises --show-vars
...
default:def.myplatform                   linux                                                        source=augments_file
default:def.phone                        22-333-4444                                                  source=augments_file
  ```

* `classes`: any class names you put here will be evaluated and installed as
  **hard classes** if they match as a class name or a regular expression. Thus:

  ```
"classes":
{
  "my_always": "any",
  "my_other_apache": [ "server[34]", "debian.*" ],
}
  ```

  results in `my_always` being always defined. `my_other_apache` will be defined
  if the classes `server3` or `server4` are defined, or if any class starting
  with `debian` is defined. You can use any classes listed in
  [Hard and Soft Classes][Hard and Soft Classes#Hard Classes].

  You can see the list of classes thus defined through `def.json` in the output
  of `cf-promises --show-classes` (see [Components and Common Control][]). They
  will be tagged with the tags `source=augments_file,hardclass`. For instance,
  the above two classes result in:

  ```
% cf-promises --show-classes
...
my_always                                                    source=augments_file,hardclass
my_other_apache                                              source=augments_file,hardclass
  ```

**History:** Introduced into the Masterfiles Policy Framework with CFEngine
3.7.0, the file `def.json` in the root of the policy directory was processed by
policy. In 3.7.3 `def.json` is looked for next to the policy entry file and
parsing was moved to C to make it more generically useful and .
