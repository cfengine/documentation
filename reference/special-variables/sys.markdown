System variables are derived from CFEngine's automated discovery of system 
values. They are provided as variables in order to make automatically adaptive 
rules for configuration.

```cf3
    files:

      "$(sys.resolv)"

          create        => "true",
          edit_line     => doresolv("@(this.list1)","@(this.list2)"),
          edit_defaults => reconstruct;
```

### sys.arch

The variable gives the kernel's short architecture description.

```cf3
    # arch = x86_64
```

**History:** Was introduced in 3.5.1, Enterprise 3.5.1.

### sys.class

This variable contains the name of the hard-class category for this host
(i.e. its top level operating system type classification).

```cf3
    # class = linux
```

**See also:** [`sys.os`][sys#sys.os]

### sys.cpus

A variable containing the number of CPU cores detected. On systems which
provide virtual cores, it is set to the total number of virtual, not
physical, cores. In addition, on a single-core system the class `1_cpu`
is set, and on multi-core systems the class *n*`_cpus` is set, where
*n* is the number of cores identified.

```cf3
    reports:

     "Number of CPUS = $(sys.cpus)";
     8_cpus::
       "This system has 8 processors.";
```

### sys.domain

The domain name as discovered by CFEngine. If the DNS is in use, it could
be possible to derive the domain name from its DNS registration, but in
general there is no way to discover this value automatically. The
`common control` body permits the ultimate specification of this value.

```cf3

detect which package name to choose when updating software binaries for
CFEngine.

These two variables are synonyms for each other.

**History:** Was introduced in 3.2.0, Enterprise 2.0

**See also:** [`sys.ostype`][sys#sys.ostype]

### sys.interface

The assumed (default) name of the main system interface on this host.

    # interface = eth0
```

### sys.interfaces

Displays a system list of configured interfaces currently active in use
by the system. This list is detected at runtime and it passed in the
variables report to the CFEngine Enterprise Database.

To use this list in a policy, you will need a local copy since only
local variables can be iterated.

```cf3
    bundle agent test
    {
    vars:

     # To iterate, we need a local copy

     "i1" slist => { @(sys.ip_addresses)} ;
     "i2" slist => { @(sys.interfaces)} ;

    reports:

        "Addresses: $(i1)";
        "Interfaces: $(i2)";
        "Addresses of the interfaces: $(sys.ipv4[$(i2)])";
    }
```

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Enterprise 2.2.0 (2011)

### sys.interface_flags

Contains a space separated list of the flags of the named interface. e.g.

```cf3
    reports:
        "eth0 flags: $(sys.interface_flags[eth0])";

Outputs:

    R: eth0 flags: up broadcast running multicast


The following device flags are supported: 

* up
* broadcast
* debug
* loopback
* pointopoint
* notrailers
* running
* noarp
* promisc
* allmulti
* multicast

**History:** Was introduced in 3.5.0 (2013)

### sys.ip_addresses

Displays a system list of IP addresses currently in use by the system.
This list is detected at runtime and passed in the variables report to the 
CFEngine Enterprise Database.

To use this list in a policy, you will need a local copy since only
local variables can be iterated.

```cf3
    bundle agent test
    {
    vars:

     # To iterate, we need a local copy

     "i1" slist => { @(sys.ip_addresses)} ;
     "i2" slist => { @(sys.interfaces)} ;

    reports:

        "Addresses: $(i1)";
        "Interfaces: $(i2)";
        "Addresses of the interfaces: $(sys.ipv4[$(i2)])";
    }
```

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Enterprise 2.2.0 (2011)

### sys.ip2iface

A map of full IPv4 addresses (key) to the system interface (value),
e.g. `$(sys.ip2iface[1.2.3.4])`.

```cf3
    # If the IPv4 address on the interfaces are
    #    le0 = 192.168.1.101
    #    xr1 = 10.12.7.254
    #
    # Then you will have
    # sys.ip2iface[192.168.1.101] = le0
    # sys.ip2iface[10.12.7.254] = xr1
```

**Note**:  

The list of addresses may be acquired with
`getindices("sys.ip2iface")` (or from any of the other associative
arrays). Only those interfaces which are marked as "up" and have an IP
address will have entries.

**History:** Was introduced in 3.9.

### sys.ipv4

All four octets of the IPv4 address of the first system interface.

**Note**:  

If your system has a single ethernet interface, `$(sys.ipv4)` will contain 
your IPv4 address. However, if your system has multiple interfaces, then 
`$(sys.ipv4)` will simply be the IPv4 address of the first interface in the 
list that has an assigned address, Use `$(sys.ipv4[interface_name])` for 
details on obtaining the IPv4 addresses of all interfaces on a system.

### sys.ipv4[interface_name]

The full IPv4 address of the system interface named as the associative
array index, e.g. `$(sys.ipv4[le0])` or `$(sys.ipv4[xr1])`.

```cf3
    # If the IPv4 address on the interfaces are
    #    le0 = 192.168.1.101
    #    xr1 = 10.12.7.254
    #
    # Then the octets of all interfaces are accessible as an associative array
    # sys.ipv4_1[le0] = 192
    # sys.ipv4_2[le0] = 192.168
    # sys.ipv4_3[le0] = 192.168.1
    #   sys.ipv4[le0] = 192.168.1.101
    # sys.ipv4_1[xr1] = 10
    # sys.ipv4_2[xr1] = 10.12
    # sys.ipv4_3[xr1] = 10.12.7
    #   sys.ipv4[xr1] = 10.12.7.254
```

**Note**:  

The list of interfaces may be acquired with `getindices("sys.ipv4")` (or
from any of the other associative arrays). Only those interfaces which
are marked as "up" and have an IP address will be listed.

### sys.ipv4_1[interface_name]


The first octet of the IPv4 address of the system interface named as the
associative array index, e.g. `$(ipv4_1[le0])` or `$(ipv4_1[xr1])`.

### sys.ipv4_2[interface_name]

The first two octets of the IPv4 address of the system interface named as the associative array index, e.g. `$(ipv4_2[le0])` or `$(ipv4_2[xr1])`.

### sys.ipv4_3[interface_name]

The first three octets of the IPv4 address of the system interface named as the associative array index, e.g. `$(ipv4_3[le0])` or `$(ipv4_3[xr1])`.
