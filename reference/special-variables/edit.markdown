This context is used to access information about editing promises during
their execution. It is context dependent and not universally meaningful or
available.

### edit.filename

This variable points to the filename of the file currently making an
edit promise. If the file has been arrived at through a search, this
could be different from the files promiser.

[%CFEngine_include_example(edit.filename.cf)%]

### edit.empty_before_use

This variable holds the value of `empty_file_before_editing` from
`edit_defaults` bodies. It's useful for altering behavior within an `edit_line`
bundle depending if the files prior content will or won't have any effect.

[%CFEngine_include_example(edit.empty_before_use.cf)%]
