Variables are promises that can be defined in any promise bundle. Users can create their 
own [variables][Variables]. 

To see all of the variables defined on a particular host, run

    $ cf-promises --show-vars

as a privileged user.  See `Classes` for an explanation of the tags.

CFEngine includes the following **special variables**:

* [const][const]  
Variables defined for embedding unprintable values or values with special meanings 
in strings.

* [edit][edit]  
Variables used to access information about editing promises during their execution.

* [match][match]  
Variable used in string matching.

* [mon][mon]  
Variables defined in a monitoring context.

* [sys][sys]  
Variables defined in order to automate discovery of system values.

* [this][this]  
Variables used to access information about promises during their execution.
