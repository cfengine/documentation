[%CFEngine_function_prototype(varref)%]

**Description:** Returns the list of keys in `varref` which can be
the name of an array or container.

This is a [collecting function][Functions#collecting functions] so it can accept many types of data parameters.

Make sure you specify the correct scope when supplying the name of the
variable.

Note the list which getindices returns is not guaranteed to be in any
specific order.

In the case of a doubly-indexed array (such as `parsestringarrayidx()` and
friends produce), the primary keys are returned; i.e. if
`varref[i][j]` exist for various `i`, `j` and you ask for the keys of
`varref`, you get the `i` values.  For each such `i` you can then ask
for `getindices("varref[i]")` to get a list of the `j` values (and so
on, for higher levels of indexing).

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(varref)%]

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(getindices.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(getindices.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

**History:** The [collecting function][Functions#collecting functions] behavior was added in 3.9.

**See also:** `getvalues()`, [about collecting functions][Functions#collecting functions], and `data` documentation.
