[%CFEngine_function_prototype(string_template, stepsize)%]

**Description:** Generates a list based on an ordered list of numbers selected from a
range of integers, in steps specified by the second argument.

The function is the inverse of functions like `iprange()` which match patterns of numerical ranges that cannot
be represented as regular expressions. The list of strings is composed from the text as quoted
 in the first argument, and a numerical range in square brackets is replaced by successive numbers
from the range.
