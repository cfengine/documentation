[%CFEngine_function_prototype(variable, maxlength)%]

**Description:** Return the environment variable `variable`, truncated at 
`maxlength` characters

Returns an empty string if the environment variable is not defined. 
`maxlength` is used to avoid unexpectedly large return values, which could 
lead to security issues. Choose a reasonable value based on the environment 
variable you are querying.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(variable, maxlength)%]

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "example" };
}

bundle agent example
{
  vars:

      "myvar" string => getenv("PATH","20");

  classes:

      "isdefined" not => strcmp("$(myvar)","");

  reports:

    isdefined::

      "The path is $(myvar)";

    !isdefined::

      "The named variable PATH does not exist";

}
```

Output:

```
R: The path is /usr/local/bin:/usr/
```

**Notes:**  

**History:** This function was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4
(2010)
