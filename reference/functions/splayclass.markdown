**Prototype**: `splayclass(input, policy)`

**Return type**: `class`

**Description**: Returns whether `input`'s time-slot has arrived, 
according to a `policy`.

The function returns true if the system clock lies within a scheduled 
time-interval that maps to a hash of `input` (which may be any arbitrary 
string). Different strings will hash to different time intervals, and thus one 
can map different tasks to time-intervals.

This function may be used to distribute a task, typically on multiple hosts, in time over a day or an hourly period, depending on the `policy` (that must be either `daily` or `hourly`). This is useful for copying resources to multiple hosts from a single server, (e.g. large software updates), when simultaneous scheduling would lead to a bottleneck and/or server overload.

The function is similar to the `splaytime` feature in `cf-execd`, except that it allows you to base the decision on any string-criterion on a given host. 

**Arguments**:

* `input` : Input string for classification, *in the range* .\*

The variation in `input` determines how effectively CFEngine will be able to 
distribute tasks. CFEngine instances with the same `input` will yield a true 
result at the same time, and different `input` will yield a true result at 
different times. Thus tasks could be scheduled according to group names for 
predictability, or according to IP addresses for distribution across the 
policy interval.

* `policy` : Splay time policy, *in the range* `daily`, `hourly`

The times at which the `splayclass` will be defined depends on the `policy`. 
If it is `hourly` then the class will be defined for a 5-minute interval every 
hour. If the policy `daily`, then the class will be defined for one 5-minute 
interval every day. This means that `splayclass` assumes that you are running 
CFEngine with the default schedule of "every 5 minutes". If you change the 
executor `schedule` control variable, you may prevent the `splayclass` from 
ever being defined (that is, if the hashed 5-minute interval that is selected 
by the `splayclass` is a time when you have told CFEngine *not* to run).

**Example**:

```cf3
    bundle agent example
    {     
    classes:

      "my_turn" expression => splayclass("$(sys.host)$(sys.ipv4)","daily");

    reports:

      my_turn::

        "Load balanced class activated";
    }
```
