[%CFEngine_function_prototype(username)%]

**Description:** Return the integer user id of the named user on this host

If the named user is not registered the variable will not be defined.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(username)%]

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "example" };
}

bundle agent example
{
  vars:

      "uid" int => getuid("mark");

  reports:
      "Users uid is $(uid)";
}
```

Output:

```
R: Users uid is 1002
```
**Notes:**
On Windows, which does not support user ids, the variable will not 
be defined.
