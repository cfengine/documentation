[%CFEngine_function_prototype(pattern, list)%]

**Description:** Return a list with each element in `list` modified by a
pattern.

The `$(this)` variable expands to the currently processed entry from `list`.
This is essentially like the map() function in Perl, and applies to
lists.

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(maplist.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(maplist.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Nova 2.2.0 (2011)
