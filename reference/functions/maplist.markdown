[%CFEngine_function_prototype(pattern, list)%]

**Description:** Return a list with each element in `list` modified by a 
pattern.

The `$(this)` variable expands to the currently processed entry from `list`. 
This is essentially like the map() function in Perl, and applies to
lists.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(pattern, list)%]

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "test" };
}

bundle agent test
{
  vars:

      "oldlist" slist => { "a", "b", "c" };
      "newlist" slist => maplist("Element ($(this))","oldlist");

  reports:
      "Transform: $(newlist)";
}
```

Output:

```
R: Transform: Element (a)
R: Transform: Element (b)
R: Transform: Element (c)
```

**History:** Was introduced in 3.3.0, Nova 2.2.0 (2011)
