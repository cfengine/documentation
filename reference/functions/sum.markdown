[%CFEngine_function_prototype(list)%]

**Description:** Return the sum of the reals in `list`.

This function might be used for simple ring computation. Of course, you could 
easily combine `sum` with `readstringarray` or `readreallist` etc., to collect 
summary information from a source external to CFEngine.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(list)%]

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "test" };
}

bundle agent test
{
  vars:
      "adds_to_six" ilist => { "1", "2", "3" };
      "six" real => sum("adds_to_six");
      "adds_to_zero" rlist => { "1.0", "2", "-3e0" };
      "zero" real => sum("adds_to_zero");

  reports:
      "six is $(six), zero is $(zero)";
}
```

Output:

```
R: six is 6.000000, zero is 0.000000
```

Because `$(six)` and `$(zero)` are both real numbers, the report that is
generated will be:

```
six is 6.000000, zero is 0.000000
```

**Notes:**  
   
**History:** Was introduced in version 3.1.0b1,Nova 2.0.0b1 (2010)
