[%CFEngine_function_prototype(filename, maxbytes)%]

**Description:** Returns the first `maxbytes` bytes from file `filename`.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(filename, maxbytes)%]

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "example" };
}

bundle agent example
{
  vars:

      "xxx"
      string => readfile( "/tmp/testfile" , "33" );
  reports:
      "content: $(xxx)";
}
```

Output:

```
R: content: $(xxx)
```

**Notes:**
- At the moment, only the first 4096 bytes of the file can be retrieved.
- To reliably read files located within /proc or /sys directories,
`maxsize` has to be set to `0`.

**History:** 4096 bytes limit and special `0` value were introduced in 3.6.0
