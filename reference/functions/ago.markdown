**Prototype**: `ago(years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds)`

**Return type**: `int`

**Description**: Convert a time relative to now to an integer system representation.

The `ago` function measures time relative to now. Arguments are applied
in order, so that ago(0,18,55,27,0,0) means "18 months, 55 days, and 27
hours ago". However, you are strongly encouraged to keep your usage of
`ago` sensible and readable, e.g., ago(0,0,120,0,0,0) or
ago(0,0,0,72,0,0).

**ARGUMENTS**:

* `years`, *in the range* 0,1000   

Years of run time. For convenience in conversion, a year of runtime is
always 365 days (one year equals 31,536,000 seconds).   

* `month`, *in the range* 0,1000   

Months of run time. For convenience in conversion, a month of runtime is
always equal to 30 days of runtime (one month equals 2,592,000 seconds).

* `days`, *in the range* 0,1000   

Days of runtime (one day equals 86,400 seconds)   

* `hours`, *in the range* 0,1000

Hours of runtime   

* `minutes`, *in the range* 0,1000

Minutes of runtime 0-59   

* `seconds`, *in the range* 0,40000

Seconds of runtime

**Example**:

```cf3
    bundle agent testbundle
    {
      processes:

       ".*"

          process_count   => anyprocs,
          process_select  => proc_finder;

      reports:

       any_procs::

         "Found processes out of range";
    }


    body process_select proc_finder

    {
      # Processes started between 5.5 hours and 20 minutes ago
      stime_range => irange(ago(0,0,0,5,30,0),ago(0,0,0,0,20,0));
      process_result => "stime";
    }

    body process_count anyprocs

    {
      match_range => "0,0";
      out_of_range_define => { "any_procs" };
    }
```
