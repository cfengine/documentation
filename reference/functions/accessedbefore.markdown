[%CFEngine_function_prototype(newer,older)%]

**Description:** Compares the `atime` fields of two files.

Return true if `newer` was accessed before `older`.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(newer, older)%]

**Example:**  


```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence  => { "example" };
}

bundle agent example
{
  classes:

      "do_it" and => { accessedbefore("/tmp/earlier","/tmp/later"), "linux" };

  reports:

    do_it::

      "The secret changes have been accessed after the reference time";
}
```

Output:

```
R: The secret changes have been accessed after the reference time
```

Example output:

```
    touch /tmp/reference
    touch /tmp/secretfile

    /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f ./unit_accessed_before.cf -K
    R: The secret changes have been accessed after the reference time
```
