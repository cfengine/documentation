[%CFEngine_function_prototype(mode, template, time)%]

**Description:** Interprets a time and date format string at a particular 
point in GMT or local time using Unix epoch time.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(mode, template, time)%]

The `mode` is either `gmtime` (to get GMT times and dates) or
`localtime` (to get times and dates according to the local
timezone, usually specified by the `TZ` environment variable).

The conversion specifications that can appear in the format `template`
are specialized for printing components of the date and time according to the system locale.

**Example:**

```cf3
    bundle agent example
    {     
      vars:
          "time" int => now();
          "now" string => strftime("localtime", "%F %T", now());
          "then" string => strftime("localtime", "%F %T", 0);

          "gmt_now" string => strftime("gmtime", "%F %T", now());
          "gmt_then" string => strftime("gmtime", "%F %T", 0);

      reports:
          "time $(time); now $(now); then $(then)";
          "time $(time); GMT now $(now); GMT then $(then)";
    }
```
**Notes:** Note that `strftime` is a standard C function and you should
consult its reference to be sure of the specifiers it allows.  The below
is from the documentation of the standard `strftime` implementation
in the glibc manual at
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Formatting-Calendar-Time.html#Formatting-Calendar-Time

Ordinary characters appearing in the `template` are copied to the
output.  Conversion specifiers are introduced by a `%` character
and end with a format specifier taken from the following list.  The
whole `%` sequence is replaced in the output string as follows:

* `%a`

The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.

* `%A`

The full weekday name according to the current locale.

* `%b`

The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

* `%B`

The full month name according to the current locale.

Using `%B` together with `%d` produces grammatically
incorrect results for some locales.

* `%c`

The preferred calendar time representation for the current locale.

* `%C`

The century of the year.  This is equivalent to the greatest integer not
greater than the year divided by 100.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%d`

The day of the month as a decimal number (range `01` through `31`).

* `%D`

The date using the format `%m/%d/%y`.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%e`

The day of the month like with `%d`, but padded with blank (range
` 1` through `31`).

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%F`

The date using the format `%Y-%m-%d`.  This is the form specified
in the *ISO 8601* standard and is the preferred form for all uses.

This format was first standardized by *ISO C99* and by *POSIX.1-2001*.

* `%g`

The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century
(range `00` through `99`).  This has the same format and value
as `%y`, except that if the ISO week number (see `%V`) belongs
to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.

This format was first standardized by *ISO C99* and by *POSIX.1-2001*.

* `%G`

The year corresponding to the ISO week number.  This has the same format
and value as `%Y`, except that if the ISO week number (see
`%V`) belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used
instead.

This format was first standardized by *ISO C99* and by *POSIX.1-2001*
but was previously available as a GNU extension.

* `%h`

The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.  The action
is the same as for `%b`.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%H`

The hour as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock (range `00` through
`23`).

* `%I`

The hour as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock (range `01` through
`12`).

* `%j`

The day of the year as a decimal number (range `001` through `366`).

* `%k`

The hour as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock like `%H`, but
padded with blank (range ` 0` through `23`).

This format is a GNU extension.

* `%l`

The hour as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock like `%I`, but
padded with blank (range ` 1` through `12`).

This format is a GNU extension.

* `%m`

The month as a decimal number (range `01` through `12`).

* `%M`

The minute as a decimal number (range `00` through `59`).

* `%n`

A single `\n` (newline) character.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%p`

Either `AM` or `PM`, according to the given time value; or the
corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as
`PM` and midnight as `AM`.  In most locales
`AM`/`PM` format is not supported, in such cases `%p`
yields an empty string.

* `%P`

Either `am` or `pm`, according to the given time value; or the
corresponding strings for the current locale, printed in lowercase
characters.  Noon is treated as `pm` and midnight as `am`.  In
most locales `AM`/`PM` format is not supported, in such cases
`%P` yields an empty string.

This format is a GNU extension.


* `%r`

The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.
In the POSIX locale, this format is equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p`.

* `%R`

The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format `%H:%M`.

This format was first standardized by *ISO C99* and by *POSIX.1-2001*
but was previously available as a GNU extension.

* `%s`

The number of seconds since the epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
Leap seconds are not counted unless leap second support is available.

This format is a GNU extension.

* `%S`

The seconds as a decimal number (range `00` through `60`).

* `%t`

A single `\t` (tabulator) character.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%T`

The time of day using decimal numbers using the format `%H:%M:%S`.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%u`

The day of the week as a decimal number (range `1` through
`7`), Monday being `1`.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%U`

The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range `00`
through `53`), starting with the first Sunday as the first day of
the first week.  Days preceding the first Sunday in the year are
considered to be in week `00`.

* `%V`

The *ISO 8601:1988* week number as a decimal number (range `01`
through `53`).  ISO weeks start with Monday and end with Sunday.
Week `01` of a year is the first week which has the majority of its
days in that year; this is equivalent to the week containing the year's
first Thursday, and it is also equivalent to the week containing January
4.  Week `01` of a year can contain days from the previous year.
The week before week `01` of a year is the last week (`52` or
`53`) of the previous year even if it contains days from the new
year.

This format was first standardized by *POSIX.2-1992* and by *ISO C99*.

* `%w`

The day of the week as a decimal number (range `0` through
`6`), Sunday being `0`.

* `%W`

The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range `00`
through `53`), starting with the first Monday as the first day of
the first week.  All days preceding the first Monday in the year are
considered to be in week `00`.

* `%x`

The preferred date representation for the current locale.

* `%X`

The preferred time of day representation for the current locale.

* `%y`

The year without a century as a decimal number (range `00` through
`99`).  This is equivalent to the year modulo 100.

* `%Y`

The year as a decimal number, using the Gregorian calendar.  Years
before the year `1` are numbered `0`, `-1`, and so on.

* `%z`

*RFC 822*/*ISO 8601:1988* style numeric time zone (e.g.,
`-0600` or `+0100`), or nothing if no time zone is
determinable.

This format was first standardized by *ISO C99* and by *POSIX.1-2001*
but was previously available as a GNU extension.

In the POSIX locale, a full *RFC 822* timestamp is generated by the format
`%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z` (or the equivalent
`%a, %d %b %Y %T %z`).

* `%Z`

The time zone abbreviation (empty if the time zone can't be determined).

* `%%`

A literal `%` character.

According to *POSIX.1* every call to `strftime` checks the contents
of the environment variable `TZ` before any output is produced.
