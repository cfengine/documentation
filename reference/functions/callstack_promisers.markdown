[%CFEngine_function_prototype()%]

**Description:** Return the promisers along the call stack for the current promise.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes()%]

This is a call stack inspection function and the specific content may be tied
to a specific CFEngine version. Using it requires writing code that takes the
specific CFEngine version into account.

The returned data container is a `slist` of promiser names. It's a much simpler
version of `callstack_callers()` intended for quick debugging.

**Example:**

```cf3
vars:
  "my_promisers" slist => callstack_promisers();
```

Output:

```
{ "my_promisers" }
```

**History:** Introduced in CFEngine 3.9

**See also:** `callstack_callers()`
