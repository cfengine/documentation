**Prototype**: `getfields(regex, filename, split, array_lval)`

**Return type**: `int`

**Description**: Fill `arrayl_lval` with fields in the lines from file `filename` that match `regex`, split on `split`.

The function returns the number of lines matched. This function is most
useful when you want only the first matching line (e.g., to mimic the
behavior of the *getpwnam(3)* on the file /etc/passwd). If you want to
examine *all* matching lines, use 
[readstringarray](reference-functions-readstringarray.html) instead.

**Arguments**:

* `regex` : Regular expression to match line, *in the range* .\*  

A regular expression matching one or more lines. The regular expression
is 
[anchored](manuals-language-concepts-pattern-matching-and-referencing.html#Anchored-vs-unanchored-regular-expressions), meaning it must match the entire 
line.   

* `filename` : Filename to read, *in the range* "?(/.\*)

The name of the file to be examined.   

* `split` : Regular expression to split fields, *in the range* .\*

A regex pattern that is used to parse the field separator(s) to split up
the file into items   

* `array_lval` : Return array name, *in the range* .\*

The base name of the array that returns the values.

**Example**:

```cf3
bundle agent example

{     
vars:

  "no" int => getfields("mark:.*","/etc/passwd",":","userdata");

reports:

  cfengine_3::

    "Found $(no) lines matching";
    "Mark's homedir = $(userdata[6])";

}
```

**Notes**:
This function matches lines (using a regular expression) in the named
file, and splits the *first* matched line into fields (using a second
regular expression), placing these into a named array whose elements are
`array[1],array[2],..`. This is useful for examining user data in the
Unix password or group files.
