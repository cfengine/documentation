[%CFEngine_function_prototype(regex, filename, split, array_lval)%]

**Description:** Fill `arrayl_lval` with fields in the lines from file `filename` that match `regex`, split on `split`.

The function returns the number of lines matched. This function is most
useful when you want only the first matching line (e.g., to mimic the
behavior of the *getpwnam(3)* on the file `/etc/passwd`). If you want to
examine *all* matching lines, use [readstringarray()][readstringarray] 
instead.

**Arguments**:

* `regex` : Regular expression to match line, in the range `.*`  

A regular expression matching one or more lines. The regular expression
is [anchored][anchored], meaning it must match the entire line.   

* `filename` : Filename to read, in the range `"?(/.*)`

The name of the file to be examined.   

* `split` : Regular expression to split fields, in the range `.*`

A regex pattern that is used to parse the field separator(s) to split up
the file into items   

* `array_lval` : Return array name, in the range `.*`

The base name of the array that returns the values.

**Example:**

```cf3
body common control
{
      bundlesequence => { "example" };
}

bundle agent example
{
  vars:

      "no" int => getfields("mark:.*","/etc/passwd",":","userdata");

  reports:
      "Found $(no) lines matching";
      "Mark's homedir = $(userdata[6])";
}
```

Output:

```
R: Found 1 lines matching
R: Mark's homedir = /home/mark
```

**Notes:**
This function matches lines (using a regular expression) in the named
file, and splits the *first* matched line into fields (using a second
regular expression), placing these into a named array whose elements are
`array[1],array[2],..`. This is useful for examining user data in the
Unix password or group files.
