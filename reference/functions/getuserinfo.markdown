[%CFEngine_function_prototype(optional_uidorname)%]

**Description:** Return information about the current user or any other, looked up by user ID (UID) or user name.

This function searches for a user known to the system. If the
`optional_uidorname` parameter is omitted, the current user (that is currently
running the agent) is retrieved. If `optional_uidorname` is specified, the user
entry is looked up by name or ID, using the standard `getpwuid()` and
`getpwnam()` POSIX functions (but note that these functions may in turn talk to
LDAP, for instance).

On platforms that don't support these POSIX functions, the function simply fails.

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(getuserinfo.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

**Typical Results:**

```
R: I am 'Mr. Current User', root shell is '/bin/bash', and the agent was started by {"description":"Mr. Current User","gid":1000,"home_dir":"/home/theuser","shell":"/bin/sh","uid":1000,"username":"theuser"}

And variable contents:
  "me": {
    "description": "Mr. Current User",
    "gid": 1000,
    "home_dir": "/home/theuser",
    "shell": "/bin/sh",
    "uid": 1000,
    "username": "theuser"
  }

  "root": {
    "description": "root",
    "gid": 0,
    "home_dir": "/root",
    "shell": "/bin/bash",
    "uid": 0,
    "username": "root"
  }

  "uid0": {
    "description": "root",
    "gid": 0,
    "home_dir": "/root",
    "shell": "/bin/bash",
    "uid": 0,
    "username": "root"
  }
```
