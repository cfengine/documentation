[%CFEngine_function_prototype(regex, string)%]

**Description:** Returns whether the [anchored][anchored] regular expression
`regex` matches the `string.`

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(regex, string)%]

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(regcmp.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(regcmp.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]
