[%CFEngine_function_prototype(list)%]

**Description:** Return the variance of the numbers in `list`.

`list` can be a data container or a regular list.

**NOTE** that the `list` can be specified as inline JSON
instead of a separate variable. This is standard across many CFEngine
functions and explained in the `mergedata()` documentation.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(list)%]

Use the `eval()` function to easily get the standard deviation (square root of the variance).

This is not part of a full statistical package but a convenience function.

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(max-min-mean-variance.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(max-min-mean-variance.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

**Notes:**

**History:** Was introduced in version 3.6.0 (2014)

**See also:** `sort()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`
