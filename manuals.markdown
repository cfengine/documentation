Here is the simplest `Hello world' program in CFEngine 3:

```cf3
    bundle agent test
    {
    reports:
        "Hello world";
    }
```

### What is CFEngine?

At its core, CFEngine is a simple framework based on promises which
supplies a rich standard library of tools to implement and manage very
large systems. The following diagram captures the scope of CFEngine.

![](manuals-scope.png)

For many users, CFEngine is simply a configuration tool â€“ i.e. software
for deploying and patching systems according to a policy. Policy is
described using promises. Every statement in CFEngine 3 is a promise to
be kept at some time or location. More than this, however, CFEngine is
not like other automation tools that \`roll out' an image of some
software once and hope for the best. Every promise that you make in
CFEngine is continuously verified and maintained. It is not a one-off
operation, but a process that can repairing itself should anything
deviate from the policy.

That clearly places CFEngine in the realm of automation, which often
begs the question: so it's just another scripting language? Certainly,
CFEngine contains a powerful scripting language, but it is not like any
other. CFEngine doesn't use a scripting language like Perl, Python or
Ruby for a reason as these languages often complicate systems and
encourage users to write long procedures instead of declarative
promises. CFEngine language is a language of promises, in which you
express very high-level intentions about a system. CFEngine then takes
the promises and compiles them into real-world action.


#### Ready to Start?

If you are impatient to [get started](gettings-started.html) writing promises,
now might be a good time to take a break from concepts and try out your first promises. You can study the [examples](examples.html) and look things up in the [reference](reference.html) as you go along.

If you want a solid foundation for your use of CFEngine, continue reading this concept guide.
