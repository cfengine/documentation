Markdown formatting is simple, and the CFEngine generator adds a few things
to make it even simpler. Here's a list of the most commonly used formats.

## Basic Formatting

```
One
Paragraph

Two
Paragraphs
```

One
Paragraph

Two
Paragraphs


`**Bold**` **Bold**

`*Italic*` *Italic*


## Links

### Link within documentation and to known pages

You can link to any documentation page section using `[linktext][PageTitle#optional section]`.

For example I can link to [collecting functions][Functions#collecting functions] using `[collecting functions][Functions#collecting functions]`.

`[top of the page][Markdown Cheatsheet], to the [Markdown Cheatsheet][], [inside page][Markdown Cheatsheet#Links] and [inside current page][#Links]`

<!--- Cheating here - this page is not published, so included from link map -->
[top of the page](markdown-cheatsheet.html), to the [Markdown Cheatsheet](markdown-cheatsheet.html), [inside page](markdown-cheatsheet.html#Links) and [inside current page](markdown-cheatsheet.html#Links)

**Note:** For known pages, see the 
[_references.md](https://github.com/cfengine/documentation-generator/blob/master/_references.md)
file.

### Link to CFEngine keyword

The documentation pre-processor will create those automatically.

```
`classes` and `readfile()`
```

<!--- cheat - otherwise we get ambiuous link target warnings -->
[`classes`][classes] and `readfile()`

However, the preprocess will not create links if the code word is in triple backticks:


    ```classes``` and ```readfile()```

```classes``` and ```readfile()```

### Link to External URL

`[Markdown Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)`

## Lists

Unordered lists - Markdown supports other markers than the asterisk, but in 
CFEngine we use only `*`.

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
   * Item 2a
* Multi paragraph item

    Four spaces indented
```

* Item 1
* Item 2
   * Item 2a
* Multi paragraph item

    Four spaces indented



Ordered lists - the numbers you use don't matter.

```
1. first
1. second
9. Third
```

1. first
1. second
9. Third

## Tables

Wiki-syntax for tables is supported, and you can be a bit sloppy
about it, although it's better to align the `|` properly.

```
| Header | Left aligned | Centered | Right aligned |
|--------|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
|text    | text | X | 234 |
```

| Header | Left aligned | Centered | Right aligned |
|--------|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
|text    | text | X | 234 |


## Code

### Inline code

    This renders as `inline code`.

This renders as `inline code`.

    This also renders as ```inline code```.

This also renders as ```inline code```.

See the note above on implicit linking - single backticks will link, triple backticks won't.

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are either indendented by four spaces:

Just indent by four spaces:

```
    $ code block
    $ without syntax highlighting
```

    $ code block
    $ without syntax highlighting

or use three backticks:

    ```
    some more code 
    in a block
    ```

```
some more code
in a block
```

To turn on syntax highlighting, specify the brush directly after the opening three
backticks. Syntax highlighting is provided by pygments. Find all available lexers [here](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).

#### CFEngine Code Blocks

If you want CFEngine syntax highlighting, use

    ```cf3
    # CFEngine block

    bundle agent example()
    {
    }
    ```

```cf3
# CFEngine code block

bundle agent example()
{
}
```


Other frequently used syntax highlighers shown below.

#### Bash Script Code Blocks

		```bash
		#!/bin/bash
        echo hi
        for i in `seq 1 10`;
        do
          echo $i
        done
		```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo hi
for i in `seq 1 10`;
do
  echo $i
done
```

#### Console Blocks

        ```console
		root@policy_server # /etc/init.d/cfengine3 stop
        ```

```console
root@policy_server # /etc/init.d/cfengine3 stop
```

#### SQL Code Blocks

		```sql
	    SELECT
	         FileChanges.FileName,
	         Count(Distinct(FileChanges.HostKey)) AS DistinctHostCount,
	         COUNT(1) AS ChangeCount
	      FROM
	         FileChanges JOIN Contexts
	      WHERE
	         Contexts.ContextName='ubuntu'
	      GROUP BY
	         FileChanges.FileName
	      ORDER BY
	         ChangeCount DESC
		```

```sql
SELECT
     FileChanges.FileName,
     Count(Distinct(FileChanges.HostKey)) AS DistinctHostCount,
     COUNT(1) AS ChangeCount
  FROM
     FileChanges JOIN Contexts
  WHERE
     Contexts.ContextName='ubuntu'
  GROUP BY
     FileChanges.FileName
  ORDER BY
     ChangeCount DESC
```

#### Diff Code Blocks

		```diff
		diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
		index 92555a2..b49c0bb 100644
		--- a/README.md
		+++ b/README.md

### Code Blocks and Lists

If you want to include a code block within a list, put two tabs (8 spaces) in front of the entire block (4 to make the paragraph part of the list item, and 4 for it a code block):

```
* List item with code

        <code goes here>
```

* List item with code

        <code goes here>


You can also use backticks (and get syntax highlighting) - just make sure the backticks are indented once:

    1. First

    	```cf3
    	# CFEngine block
    
    	bundle agent example()
    	{
    	}
    	```

    2. Second
    3. Third

1. First

	```cf3

	bundle agent example()
	{
	}
	```

2. Second
3. Third

## Including External Files

Sometimes it's nice to include an external file

<pre>
[%CFEngine_include_markdown(masterfiles/CHANGELOG.md)%]
</pre>

## Comments inside documentation

Sometimes it's nice to be able to put an internal comment into the
documentation that will not be rendered.

You can use the comment and endcomment tags in markdown files.

For example:

```
{% raw %}
{% comment %} TODO: We should try to improve this at some point.{% endcomment %}
{% endraw %}
```

Would render like this:

```
{% comment %} TODO: We should try to improve this at some point.{% endcomment %}
```

## symlink example

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(masterfiles/lib/files.cf, ^body\slink_from\sln_s.*, ^##)%]


## Variables

Referencing a version of CFEngine? Consider if that appearance should be
updated with each new version.

Variables that are defined in the front matter (thats the content between the
three dashes at the top) or in
[_config.yaml](https://github.com/cfengine/documentation-generator/blob/master/_config.yml)
in the documentation-generator repository can be used directly within markdown.

For example this is the '{{site.CFE_manuals_version}}' version of the
documentation. That variable comes from _config.yaml.

Since liquid variables look a lot like mustache variables any time you want to
show the actual variables will need to be inside of raw tags.

{% raw %}
site.CFE_manuals_version {{ site.CFE_manuals_version }}
{% endraw %}
