<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The four mission phases are sometimes referred to as

     <dl>
<dt><em>Build</em><dd>A mission is based on decisions and resources that need to
be put assembled or `built' before they can be applied. This is
the planning phase.

     <p>In cfengine, what you build is a template of proposed promises for the
machines in an organization such that, if the machines all make and
keep these promises, the system will function seamlessly as
planned. This is how it works in a human organization, and this is how
is works for computers too.

     <br><dt><em>Deploy</em><dd>Deploying really means launching the policy into production.  In
cfengine you simply publish your policy (in cfengine parlance these
are `promise proposals') and the machines see the new proposals and
can adjust accordingly. Each machine runs an agent that is capable of
keeping the system on course and maintaining it over time without
further assistance.

     <br><dt><em>Manage</em><dd>Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such incidents
traditionally set off alarms and humans rush to make new transactions
to repair them. Under CFEngine guidance, the autonomous agent manages
the system, and humans only manage knowledge and have to deal with
rare events that cannot be dealt with automatically.

     <br><dt><em>Audit</em><dd>CFEngine performs continuous analysis and correction, and commercial
editions generate explicit reports on mission status.  Users can sit
back and examine these reports to check mission progress, or examine
the current state in relation to the knowledge map for the mission.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Stem cell hosts</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
At CFEngine we talk about stem cell hosts. A stem cell host is a generic
foundation of software that is the <i>necessary and sufficient</i> basis for
any future purpose. To make a finished system from this stem cell host,
you only have to `differentiate' the system from this generic basis by running CFEngine.

   <p>Differentiation of hosts involves adding or subtracting software packages,
and/or configuring the basic system.  This strategy is cost effective,
as you do not have to maintain more than one base-line `image' for
each operating system; rather, you use CFEngine to implement and
maintain the morphology of the differences. Stem cell hosts are
normally built using PXE services by booting and installing automatically
from the network.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Recommendations for Build</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
There are many approaches to building complete systems.
When you use CFEngine, you should try to progress from
thinking only about putting bytes on disks, to planning
a long term set of promises to keep.

     <ul>
<li>What services do you want to support?
<li>What promises do you want to keep concerning these services?
<li>Are these promises sustainable and convergently implementable?
<li>Formulate proposed intentions in the form of CFEngine promises.
<li>Discuss the impact of these in your team of CFEngine Mission Specialists (more than one pair of eyes).
</ul>

   <p>It is worth spending extra time in the build planning to simplify
your system as much as possible. A clear formulation here will save
time both in maintenance and training later, as employees come and go.
The better you understand your intentions, the simpler the system will be.

   <p>We cannot emphasize enough the value of the promise discipline. If you can
formulate your requirements as promises to be kept, you have identified not only
what, where, when and how, but also who is reponsible and affected by every promise.

   <p>Building systems is resource intensive. CFEngine works well with <b>rPath</b>, allowing optimized
build that can shave off many minutes from the build time for machines. CFEngine can then take over where
rPath leaves off, performing surgically precise customization.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Recommendations for Deploy</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Deploying a policy is a potentially dangerous operation, as it will
lead to change, with associated risk. Side-effects are common, and
often result from incomplete planning. (See the CFEngine Special
Topics Guide on <i>Change Management</i>).

   <p>The following sequence forms a checklist for deploying successful policy change:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Discuss the impact of changes in the team.
<li>Commit the changes to promises in version control, e.g. subversion.
<li>Make a change in the cfengine input files.
<li>Run the configuration through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cf-promises --inform</span></samp>&rsquo; to check for problems.
<li>Move the policy to a test system.
<li>Try running the configuration in dry-run model: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cf-agent --dry-run</span></samp>&rsquo;
<li>Try running the policy once on a single system, being observant of unexpected behaviour.
<li>Try running the policy on a small number of systems.
<li>Construct a test environment and examine the effect of these promises in practice.
<li>Move the policy to the production environment.
<li>If possible, test on one or a few machines before releasing for general use.
        </ol>

   <p>CFEngine recommends a process of many small incremental changes, rather than large
high-risk deployments.

   <p>CFEngine allows you to apply changes at a much finer level of granularity than
any package based management system, thus it complements basic package management with
its deployment and real time repair (see next section).

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Recommendations for Manage</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Managing systems is an almost trivial task with CFEngine. Once a model
for desired state has been created, you just sit back and watch.  You
should be ready for `hands free' operation. No one should make changes
to the system by hand. All changes should follow the deployment
strategy above.

   <p>All that remains to do is wait for email alerts from CFEngine and to
browse reports about the system state. In CFEngine Nova, these reports
are generated automatically and integrated into the system knowledge
base.

   <p>Most email alerts from CFEngine are information only. It is possible
(but not recommended) to make CFEngine very verbose about its
operations. It is common to look for confirmation early in the phase
of adopting CFEngine, as trust in the software is building. Eventually
users turn off the verbosity and the default is for CFEngine to send
as little email or output as possible.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Consider a single line E-mail, in confirmation of a change, arriving
from 1000 computers in a single day. Learning to trust the software
saves unnecessary communication and needless human involvement.
The Nova Mission Portal makes notification and alerting largely
unnecessary.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Recommendations for Audit</h3>

<pre class="sp">

Auditing systems is a continuous process when using CFEngine
Nova. Report data are collected on a continuous and distributed
basis. These data are then collected from each distributed location
according to a schedule of your choosing to collate and integrate the
reports from all systems.

   <p>The reports CFEngine provides are meant to offer simple summaries of
the kind of information administrators need about their environment,
avoiding unnecessary detail<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <dl>
<dt><em>Available patches report</em><dd>Patches already installed on system if available.
<br><dt><em>Classes report</em><dd>User defined classes observed on the system &ndash; inventory data.
<br><dt><em>Compliance report</em><dd>Total summary of host compliance, all promises aggregated over time.
<br><dt><em>File_changes report</em><dd>Latest observed changes to system files with time discovered.
<br><dt><em>File_diffs report</em><dd>Latest observed differences to system files, in a simple diff format.
<br><dt><em>Hashes report</em><dd>File hash values measured (change detection).
<br><dt><em>Installed patches report</em><dd>Patches not yet installed, but published by vendor if available.
<br><dt><em>Installed software report</em><dd>Software already installed on system if available.
<br><dt><em>Lastseen report</em><dd>Time and frequency of communications with peers, host reliability.
<br><dt><em>Micro-audit report</em><dd>Generated by cfengine self-auditing. This report is not aggregated.
<br><dt><em>Monitor summary report</em><dd>Pseudo-real-time measurement of time series data.
<br><dt><em>Performance report</em><dd>Time cost of verifying system promises.
<br><dt><em>Promise report</em><dd>Per-promise average compliance report over time.
<br><dt><em>Promises not kept report</em><dd>Promises that were recently un-kept.

<li>Define a stem cell host template
<li>Set up PXE network booting and kickstart / jumpstart OS tools with CFEngine integrated
<li>Get CFEngine running and updating on all hosts, but making no system changes.
<li>Define a service catalogue.
<li>Discuss and formulate a policy increment, thinking convergence at all times
<li>Publish (deploy) the policy.

<li>Adjust policy if necessary, following procedures for change management (Manage)
<li>View reports (or enjoy the silence) to audit system state.

   <p>CFEngine works well with package based management software. Users of
rPath, for example, can achieve substantially improved efficiency in
the build phase. CFEngine takes over where package based systems leave
off, providing an unprecedented level of control `hands free'.
