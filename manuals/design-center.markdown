# Design Center - an introduction and walkthrough

The CFEngine Design Center is a repository of pre-made components
called *sketches* that allow you to use the full power of CFEngine
without having to learn the CFEngine policy language. Although
sketches are themselves written in the CFEngine policy language, you
can make use of them by simply installing them, configuring them using
the appropriate parameters, and deploying them on your
infrastructure. This can be easily done using both a command-line
interface called `cf-sketch`, or the Design Center UI included with
CFEngine Enterprise 3.5.0.

In this walkthrough we will show how a Design Center sketch can be
found, installed, configured, and executed as policy, using
command-line tools.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- A Unix-like system
- Git
- Perl (most Unix systems come with Perl preinstalled)
- CFEngine Community 3.5.0 or newer, or CFEngine Enterprise 3.5.0 or
  newer. Many of the components will work with CFEngine Community
  3.4.0 or later (Enterprise 3.0.0 or later), but you need 3.5.0 to
  have access to the full range of features and sketches.
- Optional but recommended: the `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` Perl module. On
  many systems it is available in the standard package repositories
  (for example, on Ubuntu Linux you can install it using `apt-get
  install libterm-readline-gnu-perl`). You can also install it using
  the `cpan` utility included with Perl.

## Basic concepts

There are a few concepts that will help you understand much better how
the Design Center works. There are three main types of "things" in the
Design Center framework:

- *Sketches* contain the code that will be executed by CFEngine to
   perform some task. Sketches are contributed by the CFEngine
   community and hosted in the Design Center repositories. Most
   sketches take a few parameters to configure their precise
   behavior. For example, the `System::tzconfig` sketch contains the
   code to update the appropriate files in the system to set the
   correct timezone.
- *Parameter sets* contain the parameters that tell a CFEngine sketch
   the details of what to do. For example, the `System::tzconfig`
   sketch takes a parameter telling it which timezone should be set in
   the system. The Design Center framework can store several parameter
   sets (each one identified by a name) for the same sketch, and from
   which you can choose to apply according to arbitrary circumstances.
- *Enviroments* Contain conditions, expressed as
   [CFEngine Class Expressions](https://github.com/cfengine/documentation/blob/master/manuals/language-concepts/classes.markdown),
   that indicate when and where a particular sketch will be executed
   with a particular set of parameters. Environments also contain
   expressions that determine when and where test and verbose modes
   will be enabled for a sketch. The Design Center can also store
   multiple named environment definitions, which you can combine in
   arbitrary ways to fine tune the execution of each sketch on each
   machine.
   
Sketches, Parameters and Environments, by themselves, do nothing. they
have to be combined into *Activations*:

An *activation* is a combination of a sketch, a parameter set and an
environment (all three specified by name) that defines which sketches
will be executed under which conditions, with which parameters. It is
only through activations that you put sketches to work, and make the
decisions as to how different parts of your infrastructure will be
configured. For example, you could have two different parameter sets
for the `System::tzconfig` sketch, one for Linux and another one for
Solaris machines. You could then, on the central CFEngine Policy
Server, create two activations:

- Activation #1: Sketch `System::tzconfig`, parameter set
`tzconfig-linux`, Environment `linux`
- Activation #2: Sketch `System::tzconfig`, parameter set
  `tzconfig-solaris`, Environment `solaris`
  
When these activations are distributed by the policy server to all the
clients, only Linux and Solaris machines will execute the
`System::tzconfig` sketch, and each one of them will apply the
appropriate parameters.

There are some other concepts that will make your use of the Design
Center even more powerful, but these are enough to get us started and
to be able to go through this tutorial.

## A Walkthrough of the CFEngine Design Center

We will now go through the basic steps needed to get started using the
Design Center.

### Checkout the Design Center repository

The Design Center is an open source project and is hosted on
GitHub. You can access the repository at
https://github.com/cfengine/design-center.

The best way to get the Design Center at the moment is to check out
its git repository. For this tutorial, we assume you will check it out
under your `$HOME/source/` directory (you can use any location you
want, just replace it throughout the following instructions):

    mkdir $HOME/source
    cd $HOME/source
    git clone https://github.com/cfengine/design-center.git

You should end up with a directory called `design-center`.  We will
call this directory the *CHECKOUT* directory and refer to it as
`$CHECKOUT` from here on.  In the examples that follow, *CHECKOUT* is
`$HOME/source/design-center`. You can save some typing by typing

    export CHECKOUT=$HOME/source/design-center
    
at the prompt.  From that point on, all command-line interaction can
use `$CHECKOUT` and it will expand to the installation directory.

### Running cf-sketch

You can run cf-sketch in interactive mode directly from its directory
under `$CHECKOUT`:

    cd $CHECKOUT/tools/cf-sketch
    ./cf-sketch.pl
    Welcome to cf-sketch version 3.5.0b1.
    CFEngine AS, 2013.

    Enter any command to cf-sketch, use 'help' for help, or 'quit' or '^D' to quit.

    cf-sketch> _

By default, `cf-sketch` gives you an interactive prompt where you can
type the commands you want to execute. Try typing `help` at the prompt
to see the descriptions of all the available commands. You can run
commands non-interactively by passing them as arguments to the
`cf-sketch.pl` script from the command line.

### Search for sketches

The first step is to find some sketches to install on your system. The
search command will, without any parameters, give you a list of all
the available sketches:

    cf-sketch> search
    
    The following sketches are available:
    
    Applications::Memcached Sketch for installing, configuring, and starting memcached.
    ...
    Yale::stdlib Yale standard library

This is useful for exploration, but might be too much information. You
can also provide a regular expression to search for a particular set
of sketches:

    cf-sketch> search system
    
    The following sketches match your query:
    
    System::Logrotate Sets defaults and user permissions in the sudoers file
    System::Routes Sets defaults and user permissions in the sudoers file
    System::Sudoers Sets defaults and user permissions in the sudoers file
    System::Syslog Configures syslog
    System::access Manage access.conf values
    System::config_resolver Configure DNS resolver
    System::cron Manage crontab and /etc/cron.d contents
    System::etc_hosts Manage /etc/hosts
    System::motd Configure the Message of the Day
    System::set_hostname Set system hostname. Domain name is also set on Mac, Red Hat and and Gentoo derived distributions (but not Debian).
    System::sysctl Manage sysctl values
    System::tzconfig Manage system timezone configuration

We can get additional information for a sketch, including details
about its parameters, using the `info` command:

    cf-sketch> info -v System::motd
    
    The following sketches match your query:
    
    Sketch System::motd
    Description: Configure the Message of the Day
    Authors: Ben Heilman <bheilman@enova.com>
    Version: 1.00
    License: MIT
    Tags: cfdc
    Installed: No
    Parameters:
      For bundle entry
        motd: string
        motd_path: string
        prepend_command: string
        dynamic_path: string
        symlink_path: string

### Install a sketch

The first step in using a sketch is to install it. Let us now install
the `System::motd` sketch:

    cf-sketch> install System::motd
    
    Sketch System::motd installed under /home/vagrant/.cfagent/inputs/sketches.
    Sketch README.md installed under System::motd.
    Sketch main.cf installed under System::motd.
    Sketch params/debian_squeeze.json installed under System::motd.
    Sketch params/debian_wheezy.json installed under System::motd.
    Sketch params/example.json installed under System::motd.
    Sketch params/simple.json installed under System::motd.
    Sketch test.cf installed under System::motd.

You can verify that the sketch has been installed using the `list`
command:

    cf-sketch> list
    
    The following sketches are installed:
    
    CFEngine::dclib Design Center standard library
    CFEngine::stdlib The portions of the CFEngine standard library (also known as COPBL) that are compatible with 3.4.0 releases
    System::motd Configure the Message of the Day

Note that the `CFEngine::dclib` and `CFEngine::stdlib` were
automatically installed as dependencies of the `System::motd` sketch.

### Activate a sketch

Before we can activate the `System::motd` sketch, and according to the
basic concepts described before, we need to have two elements: a
parameter set and an environment.

First we define the parameter set that contains the values that will
be used by the sketch:

    cf-sketch> define params System::motd
    
    Please enter a name for the new parameter set (default: System::motd-entry-000): motd_params
    Querying configuration for parameter set 'motd_params' for bundle 'entry'.
    Please enter parameter motd (Message of the Day (aka motd)).
      (enter STOP to cancel)
    motd : Hello there!
    Please enter parameter motd_path (Location of the primary, often only, MotD file).
      (enter STOP to cancel)
    motd_path [/etc/motd]: /etc/motd
    Please enter parameter prepend_command (Command output to prepend to MotD).
      (enter STOP to cancel)
    prepend_command [/bin/uname -snrvm]: /bin/uname -snrvm
    Please enter parameter dynamic_path (Location of the dynamic part of the MotD file).
      (enter STOP to cancel)
    dynamic_path :
    Please enter parameter symlink_path (Location of the symlink to the motd file).
      (enter STOP to cancel)
    symlink_path :
    Defining parameter set 'motd_params' with the entered data.
    Parameter set motd_params successfully defined.

We can confirm that the parameter set has been properly defined using
the `list` command:

    cf-sketch> list -v params
    
    The following parameter sets are defined:
    
    motd_params: Sketch System::motd
      [System::motd][dynamic_path]:
      [System::motd][motd]: Hello there!
      [System::motd][motd_path]: /etc/motd
      [System::motd][prepend_command]: /bin/uname -snrvm
      [System::motd][symlink_path]:

We also need to define an environment. For now we will define an
environment that is always active:

    cf-sketch> define environment -n walkthrough any
    
    Environment 'walkthrough' successfully defined.

The `list` command can be used to verify that the environment was
defined:

    cf-sketch> list -v env walk
    
    The following environments match your query:
    
    walkthrough
      [activated]: any
      [test]: !any
      [verbose]: !any

Note that the `test` and `verbose` fields are optional and default to
`!any`, which is equivalent to "never" in CFEnfgine terms.

Now, finally, we can activate the sketch by tying together the sketch
name, parameter set and environment:

    cf-sketch> activate System::motd motd_params walkthrough
    
    Using generated activation ID 'System::motd-1'.
    Using existing parameter definition 'motd_params'.
    Using existing environment 'walkthrough'.
    Activating sketch System::motd with parameters motd_params.

We can verify that the activation has been created:

    cf-sketch> list activations
    
    The following activations are defined:
    
    Activation ID System::motd-1
      Sketch: System::motd
      Parameter sets: [ motd_params ]
      Environment:  'walkthrough'

This means that when the sketches are deployed, the `System::motd`
sketch will be executed with the values defined in the
`motd_params` parameter set, and on the hosts that satisfy the
conditions defined in the `walkthrough` environment (which includes
all machines for now).

### Generate and execute the runfile

So far all the definitions of parameters, environments and activations
are known only to the `cf-sketch` tool. We need to deploy these
changes, which creates the appropriate CFEngine policy files for
executing the activated sketches. We have two commands for this:

The `run` command allows us to quickly test the execution of the
sketches on the local host. It generates a standalone runfile that
encodes all the necessary information for the activated sketches, and
then executes it using `cf-agent`:

    cf-sketch> run
    
    Runfile /var/cfengine/inputs/api-runfile-standalone.cf successfully generated.
    Now executing the runfile with: /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent  -f /var/cfengine/inputs/api-runfile-standalone.cf

The `deploy` command generates a non-standalone runfile that is meant
to be loaded and executed from your main `promises.cf` file:

    cf-sketch> deploy
    
    Runfile /var/cfengine/inputs/api-runfile.cf successfully generated.

## More information

The Design Center framework provides an API that takes care of
managing all the backend framework, and cf-sketch offers an "expert"
mode in addition to the interactive mode described in this
tutorial. Once you are familiar with the basic concepts and want to
learn more about how things work internally, you can take a look at
the [advanced walkthrough][Design Center - an advanced walkthrough].

You may also want to look at the
[Design Center API reference guide][The Design Center API].

Once you are ready to start writing Design Center sketches, you need
to look at the [Sketch Structure][Sketch Structure] documentation.
