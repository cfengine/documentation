CFENGINE 3 ENTERPRISE 3.0.0
RELEASE DATE: December 2012 (this document was last amended on January 24th 2013 (add notice on internal database users))
SCOPE: Upgrade instructions for CFEngine 3 Enterprise 3.0.0

For information about supported platforms, compatible hub/client configurations and an overview of changes, please see the "3.0.0-Release-Notes-CFEngine-3-Enterprise.txt" file (available in the cfengine.com software download directory).

Upgrading CFEngine 3 Enterprise can be tricky, there are many dependencies on the customer's policy. We have created shell script to optionally do the job for you, trying to be as generic as possible to not interfere with existing policy. The script is not perfect because we cannot predict all factors, such as what files customers use or do not use, what kind of a directory structure they have, etc.  Manual work (especially cosmetic work to the policy) should be made after usage of the script. 

Of course, we do not want to force you to use the upgrade script. With this document we go through each step so you can choose whether you want to use the script, or upgrade manually by doing the same steps by yourself. Whicever option you choose:

*************************************************************************************
ALWAYS TEST UPGRADE IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT PRIOR TO UPGRADING PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.
*************************************************************************************

IMPORTANT NOTICE: User authentication has changed from 2.2.x to 3.0.x. Most notably, the passwords in the internal database were previously stored in plain MD5. To increase security we now store in salted MD5. Exising users in the internal database will be wiped out and replaced by the default admin user (password admin) upon upgrade. The LDAP/AD configuration will also be wiped out, you will need to log on with the admin account and re-enter the external authentication configuration for LDAP/AD to take effect.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact your sales representative, or our support engineers through the support channel (https://cfengine.com/otrs/customer.pl)

THE UPGRADE SCRIPT IS AVAILABLE AT https://cfengine.com/software/?dir=Enterprise-3.0.0/.upgrade_script
or in the document listing for CFEngine Enterprise Free 25.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADE PROCEDURE FOR THE HUB (THE UPGRADE SCRIPT STEP BY STEP)
ALSO APPLICABLE TO MANUAL UPGRADES (but you do not need to do all of the following steps)

PREREQUISITE:
 * CFEngine 3 Enterprise HUB version 2.1.x/2.2.x
 * Linux shell

***** WARNING *****
STANDARD LIBRARY: The script will upgrade cfengine_stdlib.cf automatically. If you have added your own bodies to the file, they will be overwritten. Also, CFEngine Nova 2.0.x clients will fail to execute the new standard library. If you use the script, we suggest backing up your old cfengine_stdlib.cf and copying it over the one installed by the script.
*** END WARNING ***

 * Do not panic if the script fails. Please see how to rollback your configuration in "THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. HOW CAN I ROOLBACK MY BINARY VERSION AND CONFIGURATION?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT WHEN THE SCRIPT IS DONE?

 * If you answered "no" to "Have you ever added your custom-built promises to /var/cfengine/bin/masterfiles/failsafe.cf or /var/cfengine/masterfiles/update.cf?":

   ** Even if you anwered "no" to the question, please make sure your policy is correct by verifying the resultant policy files.

   ** verify for syntax errors
      $ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-promises -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/failsafe.cf
      $ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-promises -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf

   ** if there is no error, please run failsafe to start up all CFEngine processes
      $ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/failsafe.cf -IK

   ** We highly recommend cosmetic re-work of the resulting policy to ensure readability. See our new 3.0.0 framework in /var/cfengine/share/NovaBase

   ** You should keep all control bodies (body agent/executor/server/hub/reporter/monitor/runagent control) and server access_rule() bundle to at least have some suggested attributes

 * If you answered "yes" to "Have you ever added your custom-built promises to /var/cfengine/bin/masterfiles/failsafe.cf or /var/cfengine/masterfiles/update.cf?":

   ** you should synchronize the contents in failsafe.cf and update.cf manually. 

     *** For example; the promiser "/var/cfengine/bin/mongod <parameters>" in bundle update in update.cf: please change it to run in file-based configuration mode (this bundle is called update_policy in the 3.0.0 policy framework) .
       
       vars:

        "mongodb_dir"        string => "$(sys.workdir)/state",
                            comment => "Directory where MongoDB files will be stored on hub - if changed: requires DB shutdown and move of files",
                             handle => "cfe_internal_update_policy_mongodb_dir";

        "mongodb_conf_file"  string => translatepath("$(inputs_dir)/failsafe/mongod.conf"),
                            comment => "Path to MongoDB configuration file",
                             handle => "cfe_internal_update_policy_mongodb_conf_file";

       commands:

        !windows.am_policy_hub.start_mongod::
        
         "/var/cfengine/bin/mongod --dbpath $(update_policy.mongodb_dir) --config $(update_policy.mongodb_conf_file) > /dev/null < /dev/null 2>&1"

   ** some contents of your current bundle agent update_bins in update.cf might be outdated. Please keep it similar to /var/cfengine/share/NovaBase/failsafe/update_bins.cf as much as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. HOW CAN I ROLLBACK MY BINARY VERSION AND CONFIGURATION?

 * remove /var/cfengine/masterfiles and /var/cfengine/inputs directories
 * rename /var/cfengine/masterfiles_$(date) to /var/cfengine/masterfiles
 * remove your current 3.0.0 cfengine-nova and cfengine-nova-expansion packages
 * reinstall your previous cfengine-nova and cfengien-nova-expansion packages
 * rebootstrap the HUB. MP should be up and running in less than 10 minutes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADE PROCEDURE FOR THE CLIENTS

For client upgrades there are 2 approaches: manual or automatic upgrade.
 * Manual: Update cfengine-nova on each client by rpm, dpkg or corresponding Windows command. For Linux/UNIX systems, update cf-twin as follows:
      $ cp -vf /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent /var/cfengine/bin/cf-twin
   For Windows systems copy/overwrite the content of
      C:\Program Files\Cfengine\bin
   to
      C:\Program Files\Cfengine\bin-twin
 * Automatic: On the hub, copy the client cfengine-nova packages to the operating system specific distribution directories in /var/cfengine/master_software_updates and CFEngine 3 Enterprise will take care of the rest.
