CFEngine is comprised of a number of components: components
responsible for implementing promises, components responsible for
organizing large networks of agents, and other components responsible
for providing the infrastructure of CFEngine.

CFEngine's software agents are independent components running on the
various systems that make up your infrastructure. They communicate with one 
another as shown in the following figure, using a protocol that allows each 
host to distribute promises, act upon them, and report status to a central 
server.

Unlike other approaches to automation, CFEngine does not rely on SSH key 
authentication and configuring trust, the communication between hosts is very 
structured and also able to react to availability issues. This means that you 
don't have to arrange risk login credentials to get CFEngine to work. If large 
portions of your network stop working, individual host in the CFEngine system
understand how to keep on running and delivering promises.

If the network is not working, CFEngine agents skip new promises and continue 
with what they already have. CFEngine was specifically designed be resilient 
against connectivity issues network failure may be in question. CFEngine is
fault tolerant and opportunistic.


### Core Components

* [cf-agent](reference-components-cfagent.html)

This is the instigator of change. Everything that happens on a client machine 
happens because of cf-agent. The agent is the part of CFEngine that 
manipulates system resources.

`cf-agent`'s only contact with the network is via remote copy requests. It 
does not and cannot grant any access to a system from the network. It is only 
able request access to files from the server component.

* [cf-serverd](reference-components-cfserverd.html)

By starting this daemon you can set up a line of communication between hosts.
The server is able to share files and receive requests to execute existing 
policy on an individual machine. It is not possible to send (push) new 
information to CFEngine from outside.

This daemon authenticates requests from the network and processes them 
according to rules specified in the
[server control body](reference-components-cfserverd-control-promises.html) 
and server bundles containing
[access promises](reference-components-cfserverd-bundles-for-server.html).

* [cf-execd](reference-components-cfexecd.html)

This is a scheduling daemon (which can either supplement or replace cron). It 
also works as a wrapper, executing and collecting the output of `cf-agent` and 
E-mailing it if necessary to a system account.

* [cf-promises](reference-components-cfpromises.html)

The promise verifier and compiler. This is used to run a "pre-check" of 
configuration promises before attempting to execute.

* [cf-runagent](reference-components-cfrunagent.html)

This is a helper program which can be used to run `cf-agent` on a number of 
remote hosts. It cannot be used to tell `cf-agent` what to do, it can only ask 
`cf-serverd` on the remote host to run the `cf-agent` with its existing 
policy. It can thus be used to simulate a push of changes to CFEngine 
hosts, if their policy includes that they check for updates.

Privileges can be granted to users to provide a kind of Role Based Access 
Control (RBAC) to certain parts of the existing policy. **TODO: how?**

## Distributed Discovery

**TODO: Orchestration? Or explicit network topography page?**

CFEngine's philosophy and modus operandi is to make machines as self-reliant as possible. This is the path to scalability. Sometimes we want machines to be able to detect one another and sample each others' behaviour. This can be accomplished using probes and server functions.

For example, testing whether services are up and running can be a useful probe even from a local host. CFEngine has in-built functions for generically probing the environment; these are designed to encourage decentralized monitoring.
