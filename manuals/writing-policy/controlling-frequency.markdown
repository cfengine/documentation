When checking a series of expensive functions and verifying complex promises, 
you may want to make sure that CFEngine is not checking too frequently. One 
way of doing this is classes and class expression, another is using locks.

CFEngine incorporates a series of locks which prevent it from checking 
promises too often, and which prevent it from spending too long trying to 
check promises it has recently verified. This locking mechanism works in such 
a way that you can start several CFEngine components simultaneously without 
them interfering with each other. You can control two things about each kind 
of action in CFEngine:

    ifelapsed

The minimum time (in minutes) which should have passed since the last time 
that promise was verified. It will not be executed again until this amount of  
time has elapsed. Default time is 1 minute.

    expireafter

The maximum amount (in minutes) of time cf-agent should wait for an old 
instantiation to finish before killing it and starting again. You can think 
about `expireafter` as a timeout to use when a promise verification may 
involve an operation that could wait indefinitely. Default time is 120  
minutes.

You can set these values either globally (for all actions) or for each action 
separately. If you set global and local values, the local values override the 
global ones. All times are written in units of minutes. The following global 
setting is defined in `body agent control`.

```cf3
    body agent control
    {
        ifelapsed => "60";	# one hour
    }
```

This setting tells CFEngine not to verify promises until 60 minutes have 
elapsed, ie ensures that the global frequency for all promise verification is 
one hour. This global setting of one hour could be changed for a specific 
promise body by setting `ifelapsed` in the promise body.

```cf3
    body action example
    {
        ifelapsed => "90";	# 1.5 hours
    }
```

This promise which overrides the global 60 minute time period and defines a 
frequency of 90 minutes.

These locks do not prevent the whole of cf-agent from running, only atomic 
promise checks. Several different cf-agent instances can run concurrently, and 
the locks ensure that promises will never be verified by two cf-agents at the 
same time, or too soon after a verification.
