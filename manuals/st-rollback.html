<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is rollback?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Rollback is a term that originates from the world of <i>Transaction
Processing</i>, e.g in databases. It arises in the context of trying to
guarantee data integrity during <i>intended changes to data</i> (e.g. during copy or
write operations to a database or a disk).

   <p>Accurate change of data can fail for a variety of unpredictable
environmental reasons, so the idea is to preserve the integrity of
data during change by arranging them into predictable chunks called
<i>transactions</i>. If an error occurs during the copying of a single
data transaction, e.g. because it was interrupted or there was a
failure, then the change should be such that we are able to scrap
the affected transaction and try it again until the intention
succeeds.

   <p>The idea is a simple variation of error-correction methods in signal
transmission, where detection of an error mandates dropping a packet
and retransmitting it. Ultimately this goes back to Shannon
communication theory.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Top">Top</a>

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Like revision control?</h3>

<p>The idea has been used in other contexts too.  Revision control
systems (CVS, Subversion, etc) use the same idea to keep a record of
what <i>intended changes</i> have been made in source code or other
documents. In theory, if you intentionally commit a change that you
don't like, you can `back out' by reversing a `commit' operation and
going back to a previous version before it becomes irreversible.

   <p>This idea works well if you only ever want to undo the last atomic
transaction in a sequence of deliberate changes, however there are
limitations.  If two or more persons make changes to data in parallel,
you might not know what the last transaction was, or even that another
transaction has taken place when trying to undo a change.

   <p>Similarly, you might want to undo changes that you made a few
transactions ago, in which case you would need to undo all the changes
from that point to the current point. At that point, it is more
efficient to make a `new' revision that takes away the offending text,
rather than undoing everything that happened since.

   <p>Revsion control can also fail. Your last change might have already been
changed with or without your knowledge and simply reversing what you
changed will not be possible. 
For example, consider the file:

<pre class="smallexample">     one
     two
     three
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">User 1 commits new lines in a single transaction:

<pre class="smallexample">     one
     two
     three
     seven
     eight
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then another user transforms all the lines in a single transaction:

<pre class="smallexample">     #one
     #two
     #three
     #seven
     #eight
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">User 1 now realizes that the lines were incorrect and tries
to undo his transaction, deleting two lines `seven' and `eight' at the
end of the file, but now there are no such lines to be found where
they were expected, and the rollback fails without a graceful exit. Now
the system is in an unknown state, not merely an imperfect one.

   <p>The resolution to this problem is not to try reversing changes, but to
reanalyze the file contents and move forward. As long as changes are
small and simple, re-analysis will be a simple matter and moving
forward will be the simplest option with the least upheaval to the
system.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Limitations of rollback in system administration</h3>

<p>The term roll-back has been adopted (actually misappropriated)
in the context of IT management to mean `undo of changes during system
upgrades'. However, system upgrade is usually a very complex sequence
of <i>intended</i> transactions and <i>unintended</i> side effects, some of
which are a result of planned intentions and some of which are caused by
third parties. It is quite difficult to isolate and serialize system
changes in live operating environments, because planned changes
generally get interleaved with unplanned ones.

   <p>The concept of rollback therefore has practical limitations: the main
ones being that it requires <i>isolation</i> and <i>serialization</i> of all
change processing. If people or machines are working at the same time
on shared data, or if there is distributed work going on, this is
likely to break the <i>single point of change</i> condition required to
make transactions integral &ndash; i.e. to make rollback possbile.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ITIL release management</h3>

<p>The idea of rollback is seductive and has also been introduced into
human practices in the hope of making processes impervious to error. 
The IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a self-proclaimed set of best
practices for IT management. It borrows some ideas about transaction
integrity for human management processes.

   <p>Once again, the idea is to break up changes into chunks (ITIL calls
these chunks `releases') and verify that each release is error-free
before fully committing to it. If something goes wrong, you `roll
back' by throwing away the last chunk and try again. In order to
succeed, each chunk must be a separate entity and its integrity must
be verified before the change is accepted so that there are no
unforeseen consequences of a potential error.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Don't shoot the messenger</h3>

<p>When you make a mistake, either with a policy decision or its
implementation, and a user comes pointing a finger because the system
is broken, someone is going to ask: what was the last change that was
made that `caused' this problem? Now roll back to that version to fix
the problem (usually in an urgent voice)!

   <p>Stop right there and think again. True, it is possible that a single
change was the origin of a chain of events resulting in the problems
you have, but it is not true that going back to the previous version
of that incident will repair the problem. If you open the door to your
submarine while deep under water, closing it alone will not help get
rid of the unwanted water.

   <p>Whenever you make a mistake, you should expect to undertake a clean-up
operation that deals with all of the consequences of the
error. Tracking changes can help you to map out what needs to be
repaired, but you cannot turn back time.

   <p>One approach is a destructive one: stop the system and go back to a
checkpoint date on the filesystem. If you do that, you will lose all
your data and changes since the checkpoint, and it might still be too
late for your mission critical operation.

   <p>A less destructive way is to contain the problem by preventing more
damage from occurring, then create a new policy to automatically clean up. 
That way, if the same problem should happen again, you will have
already planned your exit strategy.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">An alternative way to plan changes</h3>

<p class="noindent">Reliable rollback is an intractable problem in most modern
datacentres, but many systems claim that they can do it without
addressing the consequences of loss or downtime. In short, relying on
the ability to roll back makes for a fragile strategy.

   <p>A better approach to error correction is planned avoidance of mistakes, and
assuming that unplanned changes will occur. You know
that there is a risk of error, so minimize the error by planning a
multitude of tiny changes rather than fewer big releases.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Make small incremental changes. 
<li>Test in a test environment. 
<li>Test in a runtime environment on the smallest possible set of machines. 
<li>Make no other planned changes until you are sure the change resulted in the
behaviour you expected. 
<li>Expand the scope of the change gradually, as your confidence grows, until
all machines are covered. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Notice that a human must be responsible for each expansion of scope. 
Always plan based on the desired state &ndash; i.e. not where you think you
are starting from, but where you want to get to. That is the only
fixed point on which to base a policy.

   <p>CFEngine can deal with the error correction against unplanned changes,
but only humans can manage <i>intentions</i>.

   <pre class="sp">


</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
WHY CAN WE DO THIS NOW? Previously the technology for making reliable
changes was poor and was based on transaction thinking, and it was
important to minimize the disruptive operations in a few
`roll-outs'. This is no longer true with CFEngine.  It is both
inexpensive and even <i>recommended</i> to make a large number of small
impact changes to respond to your needs. In this way you should
minimize the risk through small increments and testing. Moreover,
because CFEngine does <i>not</i> assume or rely on transactional
integrity, it is less prone to failures during change implementation.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How does CFEngine <i>convergence</i> help?</h3>

<p>CFEngine's change management model is not based on transactions, it is
based on a concept of convergence to a known end-state.  In
transaction management, you need to know where you started from and
the complete history of the system in order to know where you will end
up. No one has this information reliably. The alternative is
CFEngine's convergence principle. Convergence, works like a sink,
drawing the system down towards the desired state, no matter where you
start from.

<div align="center"><img src="convergence.png" alt="Rollback"></div>

   <p>Each promise in CFEngine is engineered in this way. We promise end
results, not changes. CFEngine calculates the
necessary steps and implementing them (many times if necessary) to avoid
failure.

   <p>If you make small changes to policy (small modifications to promises),
then you will not make big mistakes that need to be undone. The main
reason for failure is that our initial assumptions about the environment
were incorrect.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Plan for changes in a real environment. Base your projections on
what happens in the live system, not in the lab.

     <li>Test on the smallest possible set and expand from there.

     <li>Watch over changes and their later impact on the network as
they are made by CFEngine to see if any of your initial assumptions were wrong.

     <li>If there was a mistake, change your policy again to correct the mistake (moving forwards).

   </ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Using CFEngine, you should always be thinking of moving forwards, even
if you circle back to an earlier policy. Do not try to go back and
undo changes, think of going forwards and minimizing the repercussions
of errors. If mistakes are made, go forward again with promises that clean
up and repair.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">`Resetting' &ndash; a case where rollback works?</h3>

<p>Some environments consider `rollback' to mean, stopping destroying and
rebuilding systems from a frozen image. This is something different
from an undo operation on a running system. It applies the idea of
transactions only to the design of each `roll out' release and
turns a blind eye to what happens once a machine is taken into service.

   <p>Resetting a machine by destroying and re-building is indeed a transaction
that will roll us back to the initial state, but it is a misleading
form of integrity because you also undo all of the intended changes
that happen as part of the system's function: run-time state.

   <p>If you are willing to sacrifice run-time data then you can <i>reset</i>
a system, i.e. sacrifice or destroy it and build a new one with the
same original specification. However, you must be clear about what
is being lost:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>The system must be taken out of service.

     <li>Any run-time data must either be lost, or should be considered
`possibly contaminated' by the change that was introduced. Either way,
you need to make a decision about how to recover them. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
`Reset' is what nature does when it makes mistakes: it lets unsuccessful

</pre>

CFEngine helps here too. If you really want this kind of radical reset
and you don't mind losing runtime data, CFEngine will help you to
reconstruct the system in a predictable policy-compliant way.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Appendix - Did you know?</h3>

<p>Here are some features that can help you to recover with CFEngine's
non-destructive error correction approach:

     <ul>
<li>In <code>files</code> promises, you can use the <code>changes</code> attribute
to detect and log unexpected change in our system. This can help you
to correlate changes in policy with unexpected consequences so that you
can plan your clean-up.

     <li>When CFEngine changes or renames a file it keeps a backup of the file
before the change, of the form <samp><span class="file">filename.</span><var>suffix</var></samp>, where the
<var>suffix</var> is by default: <samp><span class="file">.cfsaved</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.cfdisabled</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.cfedited</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">.cfmoved</span></samp>.

     <li>Normally only one level of backup is kept, i.e. the next change
will overwrite this file.  If you specify <code>copy_backup =&gt;
"timestamp";</code> or <code>edit_backup =&gt; "timestamp";</code> then CFEngine will
keep multiple versions with time-stamps to keep a complete history.

     <li>If you specify a <code>repository</code> directory in a <code>files</code>
