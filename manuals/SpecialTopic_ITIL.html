<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What it ITIL?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of human management practices
surrounding IT infrastructure that are designed to bring quality assurance
and continuous improvement to organizations. 
ITIL has emerged as a de-facto set of ideas about service management. 
Many of ITIL's ideas are rooted in and legacy views of the service desk
and human remediation. This document explains how to accomplish the
major goals of ITIL, in the automated framework of CFEngine.

   <p>More concretely, the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a collection
of books, in which &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for IT Service Management (ITSM)
are described. Today, ITIL can be seen as a de-facto standard in the
discipline of ITSM, for which it provides guidelines by its current
core titles Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition,
Service Operation and Continual Service Improvement. ITIL follows the
principle of process-oriented management of IT services.

   <p>In effect, the responsibilities for specific IT management decisions
can be shared between different organizational units as the management
processes span the entire IT organization independent from its
organizational partition. Whether this means a centralization or
decentralization of IT management in the end, depends on the concrete
instances of ITIL processes in the respective scenario.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ITIL history and versions</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

ITIL has its roots in the early 1990s, and since then was subject to
numerous improvements and enhancements.  Today, the most popular
release of ITIL is given by the books of ITIL version 2 (often
referred to as ITILv2), while the British OGC (Office of Government
Commerce), owner and publisher of ITIL, is currently promoting ITIL
version 3 (ITILv3) under the device "`ITIL Reloaded"'. A further ITIL
version has already been planned, owing to perceived problems with
version 3.

   <p>ITILv3 is not just an improved version of the ITILv2 books, but rather
comes with a completely renewed structure, new sets of processes and a
different scope with respect to the issue of IT strategies,
IT-business-alignment and continual improvement. In the following, we
run through the basics of both versions, highlighting commonalities
and differences.

ITIL is an attempt to implement the <i>Deming Quality Circle</i> as a
model for continual quality improvement. Quality relates to the
provided IT services as well as the management processes deployed to
manage these services. Continual improvement in ITIL means to follow
the method of Plan-Do-Check-Act:

     <dl>
<dt><b>Plan</b><dd>Plan the provision of high-quality IT services, i.e. set up the required management processes for the delivery and support of these services, define measurable goals and the course of action in order to fulfill them. 
<br><dt><b>Do</b><dd> Put the plans into action. 
<br><dt><b>Check</b><dd> Measure all relevant performance indicators, and quantify the achieved quality compared to the quality objectives. Check for potentials of improvement. 
<br><dt><b>Act</b><dd> In response to the measured quality, start activities for future improvements. This step leads into the Plan phase again.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Although ITIL version 3 was released during the summer of 2007,
it is its predecessor that has achieved great acceptance amongst
IT service providers all over the world. Also due to the fact that the
International ISO/IEC 20000 standard emerged from those
basic principles and processes coming from ITILv2, it is this version
experiencing the biggest distribution and popularity.

   <p>The core modules of ITIL version 2 are the books entitled Service
Support and Service Delivery. While the Service Support processes
(e.g. Incident Management, Change Management) aim at supporting
day-to-day IT service operation, the Service Delivery processes
(e.g. Service Level Management, Capacity Management, Financial
Management) are supposed to cover IT service planning like resource
and quality planning, as well as strategies for customer relationships
or dealing with unpredictable situations.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Version 3</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

In 2007, version 2 was replaced by its successor version 3, aimed at
covering the entire service life cycle from a management
perspective and striving for a more substantiated idea of IT business alignment. 
Many version 2 processes and ideas have been recycled
and extended by various additional processes and principles. The five
service life cycle stages accordant to versin 3 are:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Service Strategy: Common strategies and principles for customer-oriented, business-driven service delivery and management
<li>Service Design: Principles and processes for the stage of designing new or changed IT services
<li>Service Transition: Principles and processes to ensure quality-oriented implementation of new or changed services into the operational environment
<li>Service Operation: Principles and processes for supporting service operation
<li>Continual Service Improvement: Methods for planning and achieving service improvements at regular intervals

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Service orientation and ITIL</h3>

<p>Why service and process orientation? What is ITIL trying to do? As we
mentioned in the introduction, the `top down hierarchical' control
view of human organization fell from favour in business research in
the 1980s and service oriented autonomy was identified as a new
paradigm for levelling organizations &ndash; getting rid of deep
hierarchies that hinder communication and open up communication
directly.

   <p>If we look at ITIL through the eyeglass of a hierarchical organization,
some of its procedures could be seen as restrictive, throttling
scalable freedoms. We do not believe
that this is their intention. Rather ITIL's guidelines try to make a
predictable and reliable face for business and IT operations so that
customers feel confidence, without choking the creative process that
lies behind the design of new services.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">CFEngine in ITIL clothes?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine users are interested in the ability to manage, i.e. cope with
system configuration in a way that enables a business or other
organization to do its work effectively. They don't want
human procedures because this is what CFEngine is supposed to
eliminate. To be able to use ITIL to help in this task, we have to first
think of the process of setting up as a number of services.  What
services are these? We have to think a little sideways to see the
relationship.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Service Management</b><dd>Providing a sensible configuration policy, responding to discovered problems or the needs of end-users. 
<br><dt><b>Change Management</b><dd>A minor edit of the configuration policy, with appropriate quality controls. Or a change that comes
from a completely different source, outside the scope of intended change. 
<br><dt><b>Release Management</b><dd>A new configuration policy, consisting of many changes. This could be a major and disruptive change so it should be planned carefully. 
<br><dt><b>Capacity Management</b><dd>Having enough resources for cfservd to answer all queries in a network. Having enough people and machines to support the processes of deploying and following CFEngine's progress.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Service Strategy</h4>

<p>Service strategy is about deciding what services you want to
formalize. In other words, what parts of your system administration tasks can you
wrap in procedural formalities to ensure that they are carried out most excellently?

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Service Design</h4>

<p>Service design is about deciding what will be delivered, when it will be delivered,
how quickly the service will respond to the needs of its clients etc. This stage is probably
something of a mental barrier to those who are not used to service-oriented thinking.

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Service Operation</h4>

<p>How shall we support service operation? What resources do we need to provide, both human
and computer? Can we be certain of having these resources at all times, or is there
resource sharing taking place? If services are chained into &ldquo;supply chains&rdquo;, remember that
each link of the chain is a possible delay, and a possible misunderstanding. Successfully running
services can be more complex at task than we expect, and this is why it is useful to
formalize them in an ITIL fashion.

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Continual Service Improvement</h4>

<p>Continual improvement is quite self-explanatory. We are obviously
interested in learning from our mistakes and improving the quality and
efficiency by which we respond to service requests. But it is
necessary to think carefully about when and where to introduce this
aspect of management. How often should we revise out plans and change
procedures?  If this is too often, the overhead of managing the quality
becomes one of the main barriers to quality itself! Continual has to mean regular
on a time-scale that is representative for the service being provided, e.g. 
reviews once per week, once per month? No one can tell you about your needs. 
You have to decide this from local needs.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Tool Support</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

In the field of tool support for IT Service Management accordant to
ITIL, various white papers and studies have been published. In
addition, there are papers available from BMC, HP, IBM and other
vendors that describe specific (commercial) solutions. Generally, the
market for tools is growing rapidly, since ITIL increasingly gains
attention especially in large and medium-size enterprises. Today, it
is already hard to keep track of the variety of functionalities
different tools provide. This makes it even more difficult to approach
this topic in a way satisfactory to the entire researchers', vendors'
and practitioners' community.

   <p>That is why this document follows a different approach: Instead of thinking
of ever new tools and computer-aided solutions for ITIL-compliant IT Service
Management, this book analyses how the existing and well-established
technologies used for traditional systems administration can
fit into an ITIL-driven IT management environment, and it guides
potential practitioners in integrating a respective tool suite &ndash; namely
CFEngine &ndash; with ITIL and its processes.

   <p>To avoid any misunderstanding: We do not argue that CFEngine &ndash;
originally invented for configuring distributed hosts &ndash; may be
deployed as a comprehensive solution for automating ITIL, but what we
believe is CFEngine and its more recent innovations can <em>bridge
the gap</em> between the technology of distributed systems management and
business-driven IT Service Management. 
To make the case we must show:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>How ITIL terminology relates to the terminology of CFEngine and hence
to a traditional system administrator's language, and
<li>Which parts (processes and activities) of
ITIL can be (partially) supported by CFEngine, and how.
        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Which ITIL processes apply to CFEngine?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

<img src="itilfcaps.png" alt="FCAPS and ITIL">

   <p>In version 2, ITIL divides itself into <em>service
support</em> and <em>service delivery</em>.  For
instance, service support might mean having a number of CFEngine
experts who can diagnose problems, or who have sufficient knowledge
about CFEngine to solve problems using the software. It could also
mean having appropriate tools and mechanisms in place to carry out the
tasks. Service delivery is about how these people make their knowledge
available through formal processes, how available are they and how
much work can they cope with? CFEngine enables a few persons to
perform a lot of work very cheaply, but we should not forget to track our performance
and quality for the process of continual improvement.

   <p>Service support is composed of a number of issues:
     <ul>
<li>Incident management: collecting and dealing with incidents. 
<li>Problem management: root cause analysis and designing long term countermeasures. 
<li>Configuration management: maintaining information about hardware and software and
their interrelationships. 
<li>Change management: implementing major sequenced changes in the infrastructure. 
<li>Release management: planning and implementing major &ldquo;product&rdquo; changes. 
</ul>
   Although the difference between change management and release
management is not completely clear in ITIL, we can think of a release
as a change in the nature of the service, while change management
deals with alterations possibly still within the scope of the same release. 
Thus is release is a more major change.

   <p>Service delivery, on the other hand, is dissected as follows:
     <ul>
<li>Service Level Management
<li>Problem management
<li>Configuration management
<li>Change management
<li>Release management
</ul>
   These issues are somewhat clearer once we understand the usage of the
terms &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, &ldquo;service&rdquo; and &ldquo;configuration&rdquo;. Once again, it
is important that we don't mix up configuration management in ITIL
with configuration management as used in a Unix parlance.

   <p>The notion of system administration in the sense of Unix does not
exist in ITIL. In the world of business, reinvented through the eyes
of ITIL's mentors, system administration and all its functions are
wrapped in a model of service provision.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">ITIL Configuration Management (CM)</h4>

<pre class="sp">

Perhaps the most obvious example is the term configuration management.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Configuration Management</b><dd>The process (and life-cycle) responsible for maintaining information
about configuration items (CI) required to deliver an IT service,
including their relationships. 
</dl>

   <p>As we see, this is comparable to our intuitive idea of &ldquo;asset
management&rdquo;, but with &ldquo;relationships&rdquo; between the items
included. ITIL also defines &ldquo;Asset Management&rdquo; as &ldquo;a process
responsible for tracking and reporting the value of financially valuable assets&rdquo;
and is a component of ITIL Configuration Management.

   <p>In the CFEngine world, configuration management involves planning,
deciding, implementing (&ldquo;base-lining&rdquo;) and verifying (&ldquo;auditing&rdquo;)
the inventory. It also involves maintaining the security and privacy
of the data, so that only authorized changes can be made and private
assets are not made public.

   <p>In this document we shall try not to mix the ITIL concept with the
more prosaic system administration notion of a configuration which
includes the current state of software configuration on the
individual computers and routers in a network.

   <p>Since CFEngine is a completely distributed system that deals with
individual devices on a one-by-one basis, we must interpret this asset
management at two levels:

     <ul>
<li>The local assets of an individual device at the level of virtual
structures and containers within it: files, attributes, software packages,
virtual machines, processes etc. This is the traditional domain of automation
for CFEngine's autonomic agent.

     <li>The collective assets of a network of such devices. 
</ul>
   Since a single host can be thought of as a network of assets connected
through virtual pathways, it really isn't such a huge leap to see the
whole network in a similar light. This is especially true when many of the
basic resources are already shared objects, such as shared storage.

Why bother to collect an inventory of this kind? Is it bureaucracy
gone mad, or do we need it for insurance purposes? Both of these
things are of course possibilities.

   <p>The data in an ITIL Configuration Management Database (CMDB) can be
used for planning the future and for knowing how to respond to
incidents, in other words for service level management (SLM) and for
capacity planning.  An organization needs to know what resources it
has to know whether its can deliver on its promises. 
Moreover, for finance and insurance it is clearly a sound policy to have a database of
assets.

   <p>For continuity management, risk analysis and redundancy assessment we
need to know how much equipment is in use and how much can be brought
in at a moment's notice to solve a business problem.  These are a few
of the reasons why we need to keep track of assets.

If we make changes to a technical installation, or even a business
process, this can affect the service that customers experience. 
Major changes to service delivery are often written into service level
agreements since they could result in major disruptions. 
Details of changes need to be known by a help-desk and service personnel.

   <p>The decision to make a change is more than a single person should
usually make alone (see the CFEngine Special Topics Guide on <i>Change
Management</i>).  ITIL recommends an advisory board for changes.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Change management vs convergence</h4>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We should be especially careful here to decide what we mean by
change. ITIL assumes a traditional model of change management that
CFEngine does not necessarily need. ITIL's ideas apply to the management of
CFEngine's configuration, not specifically to the way in which CFEngine carries out its
automated manipulations of the system.

   <p>In traditional idea of change management you start by &ldquo;base-lining&rdquo; a
system, or establishing a known starting configuration. Then you
assume that things only change when you actively implement a change,
such as &ldquo;rolling out a new version&rdquo; or committing a release. This,
of course, is very optimistic.

   <p>In most cases all kinds of things change beyond our control. Items are
stolen, things get broken by accident and external circumstances
conspire to confound the order we would like to preserve. The idea
that only authorized people make changes is nonsense.

   <p>CFEngine takes a different view. It thinks that changes in
circumstances are part of the picture, as well as changes in inventory
and releases.  It deals with the idea of &ldquo;convergence&rdquo;.  In this way
of thinking, the configuration details might be changing at random in
a quite unpredictable way, and it is our job to continuously monitor
and repair general dilapidation. Rather than assuming a constant state
in between changes, CFEngine assumes a constant &ldquo;ideal state&rdquo; or
<em>goal</em> to be achieved between changes. An important thing to realize about including
changes of external circumstances is that you cannot &ldquo;roll back&rdquo;
circumstances to an earlier state &ndash; they are beyond our control.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

A <em>release</em> in ITIL is a collection of authorized changes to a system. 
One part of Change Management is therefore <em>Release Management</em>. 
A release is generally a larger umbrella under which many smaller
changes are made.  It is major change. 
Changes are assembled into <em>releases</em> and then they are rolled out.

   <p>In fact release management, as described by ITIL, has nothing to do
with change management. It is rather about the management of
designing, testing and scheduling the release, i.e. everything to do with
the release process except the explicit implementation of it. 
<em>Deployment</em> or <em>rollout</em> describe the physical movement of
configuration items as part of a release process.

ITIL distinguishes between <em>incidents</em> and <em>problems</em>. An incident is
an event that might be problematic, but in general would observe
incidents over some length of time and then diagnose <em>problems</em> based
on this experience.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Incident</i><dd>An event or occurrence that demands a response. 
</dl>

   <p>One goal of CFEngine is to plan pro-actively to handle incidents
automatically, thus taking them off the list of things to worry about.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Problem</i><dd>A pattern of consequence arising from certain incidents that is detrimental
to the system. It is often a negative trend that needs to be addressed. 
</dl>

   <p>Changes can introduce new incidents. 
An integrated way to make the tracking of cause and effect easier is
clearly helpful. If we are the cause of our own problems, we are in
trouble!

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Using CFEngine to implement ITIL objectives</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

How does CFEngine fit into the management of a service organization? 
There are several ways:
     <ul>
<li>It offers a rapid detection and repair of faults that help to avoid formal incidents. 
<li>It simplifies the deployment (release) of services. 
<li>Allows resources to be understood and planned better. 
</ul>
   These properties allow for greater <em>predictability</em>
of system services and therefore they contribute to customer confidence.

   <p>Any tool for assisting with change management lies somewhere between
ITIL's notion of change management and the infrastructure itself. It
must essentially be part of both (see figure). This applies
to CFEngine too.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="cfinf.png" alt="CFEngine is both infrastructure and a part responsible for infrastructure."></div>

   <p>CFEngine can manage itself as well as other resources: itself, its
software, its policy and the resulting plans for the configuration of
the system. In other words, CFEngine is itself part of the infrastructure
that we might change.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Traditional methods of managing IT infrastructure involve working from
crisis to crisis &ndash; waiting for `incidents' to occur and then initiating fire
suppression responses or, if there is time, proactive changes. With CFEngine,
these can be combined and made into a management <em>service</em>, with
continuous service quality.

   <p>CFEngine can assist with:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Maintenance assurance. 
<li>Reporting for auditing. 
<li>Change management. 
<li>Security verification.
        </ol>

   <p>Promise theory comes with a couple of principles:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Separation of concerns. 
<li>Fundamental attention to autonomy of parts.
        </ol>

   <p>Other approaches to discussing organization talk about the separation
of concerns, so why is promise theory special?  Object Orientation
(OO) is an obvious example. Promise theory is in fact quite different to
object orientation (which is a misnomer).

   <p>Object orientation asks users to model abstract classes (roles) long
before actual objects with these properties exist. It does not provide
a way to model the instantiated objects that later belong to those
classes. It is mainly a form of information structure
modelling. Object orientation models only abstract patterns, not
concrete organizations.

   <p>Promise theory on the other hand considers only actual existing objects
(which it calls agents) and makes no presumptions that any
two of these will be similar. Any patterns that might emerge can be
exploited, but they are not imposed at the outset. Promise theory's
insistence on autonomy of agents is an extreme viewpoint from which
any other can be built (just as atoms are a basic building block from which
any substance can be built) so there is no loss of generality by making
this assumption.

   <p>In other words, OO is a design methodology with a philosophy, whereas
promises are a model for an arbitrary existing system.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is maintenance?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Maintenance is a process that ITIL does not formally spend any time
on explicitly, but it is central to real-world quality control.

   <p>Imagine that you decide to paint your house. Release 1 is going to be
white and it is going to last for 6 years. Then release 2 is going to
be pink. We manage our painting service and produce release
1 with all of the care and quality we expect. Job done? No.

   <p>It would be wrong for us to assume that the house will stay this fine
colour for 6 years. Wind, rain and sunshine will spoil the paint over
time and we shall need to touch up and even repaint certain areas in
white to maintain release 1 for the full six years. Then when it is time
for release 2, the same kind of maintenance will be required for that too.

   <p>Unless we read between the lines, it would seem that ITIL's answer to
this is to wait for a crisis to take place (an incident). We then
mobilize some kind of response team. But how serious an incident do we
require and what kind of incident response is required? A graffiti artist? 
A lightening strike? A bird anoints the paint-work? CFEngine is
like the gardener who patrols the grounds constantly plucking weeds,
before the flower beds are overrun. Call it continual improvement if
you like: the important thing is that the process your be pro-active
and not too expensive.

   <p>Maintenance is necessary because we do not control all of the
changes that take place in a system. There is always some kind of
&ldquo;weather&rdquo; that we have to work against. CFEngine is about this
process of Maintenance. We call it &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; to the ideal state,
where the ideal state is the specified version release. 
Keep this in mind as you read about ITIL change management.

ITIL is about processes designed mainly for humans in a workplace. It
represents a service oriented view of an organization, and as such is
more scalable than hierarchical views of management. CFEngine is also
a service oriented technology, thus there is some overlap of concepts. 
Indeed CFEngine is a good tool for implementing and assisting in
certain ITIL processes, but we believe that no automation system can
really support what ITIL is about.

CFEngine's default modus operandi is to <em>not</em> record changes made

log entries or audit entries by switching on reporting.</td></tr></table>

   <p>An &ldquo;inform&rdquo; promise means that cf-agent promises to notify the
changes to its standard output (which is usually sent by email or
printed on a console output). A &ldquo;syslog&rdquo; promise implies that
cfagent will log the message to the system log daemon. Both of the
foregoing messages give only a simple message of actual changes.  An
&ldquo;audit&rdquo; promise is a promise to record extensive details about the
process that cfagent undergoes in its checking of other promises.

<p>Why not simply abandon autonomy of machines if this seems to interfere

autonomy is the correct model for resources.  Autonomy reduces the risk to a
resource of attack, mistake and error propagation.

   <p>ITIL's processes exist precisely to minimize the risk of negative
impact of change, so the goals are entirely compatible. When an organization
discusses a change it examines information from possible several autonomous
systems and discusses how they will change their pattern of collaboration. 
There is no point in this process at which it is necessary for one of the
systems to give up its autonomy.
