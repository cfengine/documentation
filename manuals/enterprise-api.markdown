The CFEngine Enterprise API allows HTTP clients to interact with the Hub of a CFEngine Enterprise 3.0 installation. With the Enterprise API, you can:

-   Check installation status
-   Manage users, groups and settings
-   Browse host (agent) information and policy
-   Issue flexible SQL queries against data collected by the Hub from agents
-   Schedule reports for email and later download

The Enterprise API is a REST API, but a central part of interacting with the API involves using SQL. This is new in 3.0 and was done to provide users with maximal flexibility for crafting custom reports based on the wealth of data residing on the Hub.
