As seen in the CFEngine Enterprise sketch flow (TODO: link to enterprise-sketch-flow.markdown),
the contents of `/var/cfengine/design-center/sketches` controls what is available to users
of the Design Center GUI. This document will explain how to adjust the available sketches
and add your own.

Please note that the Design Center GUI imposes requirements on the sketches to be able
to sufficiently guide the user of the GUI. See Sketch Structure (TODO: link to reference/sketch.markdown)
for a complete list of sketch requirements for CFEngine Enterprise compatibility.
