<pre class="sp">

</pre>
DevOps is a term coined by Patrick Debois in 2009, from an
amalgamation of Development and Operations. It expresses a
change in the way companies are thinking about IT &ndash; a change from segregated
IT infrastructure to highly integrated platforms. 
Leading the way is a group of highly innovative Web-based companies
whose businesses depend on very specific arrangements of
infrastructure. It is about giving software developers more influence
over the IT infrastructure their applications run on, and allowing
change at the same speed as agile development teams.

<pre class="sp">

The proliferation of Free and Open Source
software has put powerful software components in the hands of a
broader range of developers than ever before &ndash; and businesses
everywhere are exploiting this software by adapting it and combining
it is a wealth of mutations.  This blurs the line between what used to
be development and what used to be the system administrator's domain (operations). 
We have entered an age analogous to that of hobby electronics for IT
systems, where we can order off-the-shelf components and build cool
new applications from them anywhere.

   <p>After 20 years of scepticism, business and Free Open Source software have
made friends and are working together creatively for the benefit of
willing consumers. 
With this basic premise of agility, companies working in this area
naturally embrace a rapid innovation cycle, meaning a fast release
cycle too.  Traditional IT management methods can be perceived as too
slow in such an environment. An important part of DevOps is that it
naturally encompasses the idea of business integration &ndash; or IT
for a purpose.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Should Web and IT management be closely related?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

Web frameworks have seen the rise of languages like PHP, Java, Python
and Ruby, all of which offer frameworks for fast deployment. 
Languages that work well for application development are not well
suited to managing infrastructure however: they focus too much on low
level details that one would like to suppress. The fact that
programmers already know the languages does not change this.

   <p>An important principle for robustness and stability of systems is weak
coupling between components. This brings flexibility rather than brittle
fragility. Giving programmers direct control over
infrastructure from their applications risks insufficient separation
in which infrastructure management becomes a second-class citizen run
by amateurs who just want to get code out there and don't properly
understand the implications. The System Administrator role exists for
a reason.

   <p>Should we use the web and HTTP for everything just because we
know it?  We suggest not. HTTP is an inefficient protocol
for operations. It was designed for 1:1 communication with centralized
certificate verification, not for decentralized 1000000:1
communication, as testified by the extensive need for load balancers
in web farms.

   <p>At CFEngine, we believe in lightweight management &ndash; made as simple
as possible, but no simpler.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How do we make controlled change faster?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

It is important to be able to make changes quickly. Automation can
implement change quickly if humans can get their acts together. Human
IT processes and best practices (e.g. ITIL, COBIT, etc) tend to over
bureaucratize change, leading to unnecessary overhead which frustrates
agile companies.

   <p>To be confident and efficient (`less haste more speed'), there needs
to be a model for the system that everyone agrees on. Models compress
information and cache understanding, meaning we have less to talk
about<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Finally, models allow us to make
predictions, so they aid understanding and help us to avoid mistake.

CFEngine's promise model offers a flexible approach to weakly-coupled

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What role does CFEngine play in DevOps?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

The challenges for IT management today are about increasing complexity (driven
by the circuitry of online applications) and increasing scale.

   <p>CFEngine is not a programming language, but a documentation language
for system state that has the pleasant side effect of enforcing that
state on a continuous basis. It gets away from the idea of `build
automation' to complete lifecycle management. It's continuity is a
natural partner for a rapid development environment, as mistakes can be
quickly fixed on the fly with minimal impact on the system.

   <p>CFEngine's wins are that it is massively scalable, very low impact and rich in functionality. 
It will not break at a few hundred machines or choke off network communications with
overhead. It will fix practically any well-defined problem within 5 minutes, bringing dependability and
agility.

   <p>Knowledge, business integration - metrics

   <p>The advantage CFEngine brings is that users can have clear expectations about their
systems at all times. Today's programmers are more sophisticated than script monkeys.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Getting used to declarative expression</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine uses a pragmatic mixture of the declarative (functional) and
imperative to represent configurations. Programmers are taught mainly
imperative programming today, so a declarative approach could seem like
a barrier to adoption. The principles are very simple however, and easy for
developers to grasp.

   <p>In spite of the focus on readability for documenting <i>intent</i>,
all the familiar structures of imperative programming are, in fact, available
in CFEngine, just optimized for clarity.

Most of the actionable items have builtin operational support,
which is designed to be convergent and safely repeatable. 
To keep declarations clear, CFEngine organizes similar
operations into chapters in a simple separation of concerns.

<pre class="example">     files:
      <var>"affected object" ...details....</var>
     
     processes:
      <var>"affected object" ...details....</var>

<pre class="sp">

CFEngine uses the idea of contexts (also called classes or class-contexts<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>) to address declarations to
certain environments. The contexts or classes are written as a prefix, a bit like a
target in a Makefile. They represent known properties of the environment. 
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">      bundle agent SomeUserDefinedName
      {
      type_of_promise:
     
        <b>property::</b>
     
          <i>make one promise...</i>
     
        <b>!property::</b>
     
          <i>make a different promise...</i>
      }
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>
   This is the mechanism by which all decisions are made in CFEngine. Class contexts
are evaluated by <code>cf-agent</code> and are cached so that they can be used at any time.

   <p>How do we know if the property has been evaluated or not? CFEngine evaluates certain
hard-classes by default. In addition, you can probe as many more as you like, as
separate promises.
<pre class="verbatim"> classes:

   "cached_result"<span class="red"> expression </span>=> fileexists("/some/file");
   "bigger"<span class="red">        and </span>=> { isgreaterthan("1","0"), "cached_result" }; 

</pre>
This is different from a programming language where you generally make these tests
in-line when you need them. In CFEngine the chance that you need the same test multiple
times is greater, so the determination is separated entirely from the usage.

   <p>To go from <i>if-then-else</i> thinking to using classes, you just need to thihnk about
classes as booleans:
<pre class="example">     bundle agent Name
     {
     classes:
     
        "cached_result" expression =&gt; fileexists("/some/file");
        "bigger"        and =&gt; { isgreaterthan("1","0"), "cached_result" };
     
     reports:
     
       <b>bigger::</b>
         "Bigger is true....";
     
       <b>cached_result&amp;!bigger::</b>
         "Mathematics seems to be awry...";
     
       # may also be written <b>cached_result.!bigger::</b>
     
     }
</pre>
   <p>These results can then be extended and reused efficiently. 
The class definitions can be hidden away and suitably meaningful class names
replace a lot of redundant syntax.

   <p>All the information about class contexts is evaluated at the end-host,
in a decentralized manner avoiding clogging of network communications
that befuddles many centralized approaches. This keeps CFEngine execution
very fast and with a low overhead.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Expressing loops in CFEngine</h4>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Lists and loops go hand in hand, and they are a very effective way of reducing
syntax and simplifying the expression of intent. Saying `do this to all the following'
is generally easier to comprehend than `do this to the first, do this to the next,...' and
so on, because our brains are wired to see patterns.

   <p>Thus, loops are as useful for configuration as for programming.  We
only want to simplify the syntax once again to hide redundant words
like `foreach'. To do this, CFEngine makes loops implicit. If you
use a scalar variable reference &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(mylist)</span></samp>&rsquo; to a list variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(mylist)</span></samp>&rsquo;, CFEngine assumes you want to iterate over each
case.
<pre class="verbatim">vars:
   "my_list"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "one", "two", "three" };

<span class="red">files:
</span>   "/tmp/file_$(my_list)"
<span class="red">             create </span>=><span class="green"> "true";</span>

</pre>
The above evaluates to three promises:
<pre class="example">     files:
     
        "/tmp/file_one"
                  create =&gt; "true";
     
        "/tmp/file_two"
                  create =&gt; "true";
     
        "/tmp/file_three"
                  create =&gt; "true";
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Similarly the following
<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent x
{
<span class="red">vars:
</span>   "hi"<span class="red">   string </span>=><span class="green"> "Hello";</span>
   "list1"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "a", "b", "c" };
   "list2"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "1", "2", "3", "4" };

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Expressing subroutines in CFEngine</h4>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Subroutines are used for both expressing and reusing parameterizable
chunks of code, and for naming chunks for better management of intention. 
In CFEngine you define these as <code>methods</code>. A method is simply a bundle
of promises, possibly with parameters. To call a method, you make a
method-use-bundle promise. In this example, we call a bundle called <code>subtest</code>
which accepts a parameter from its calling bundle.

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
<span class="comment"># Master execution list
</span>
<span class="red">bundlesequence  </span>=> { "testbundle"  };
}

<span class="comment">###########################################
</span>

<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">testbundle</span>
{
<span class="red">vars:
</span> "userlist"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "one", "two", "three" };

<span class="red">methods:
</span> "any"<span class="red"> usebundle </span>=><span class="blue"> subtest("$(userlist)");</span>
}

<span class="comment">###########################################
</span>

<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">subtest(user)</span>
{
<span class="red">commands:
</span>  "/bin/echo Fix $(user)";
}

</pre>
The use of methods brings multi-dimensional patterns
to convergent configuration management.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Using CFEngine to integrate software components</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Integration of software components may be addressed with a variety
of approaches and techniques:

     <ul>
<li>Standard template methods from the COPBL community library (`out of the box'
solutions). 
<li>Customized, personalized configurations. 
<li>Package management for software dependencies. 
<li>File management - copying, editing, permissions, etc. 
<li>Process management - starting, stopping, restarting. 
<li>Security. 
<li>Monitoring performance and change. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Needless to say, all of these are easily achievable with 5 minute repair accuracy
using our CFEngine framework.

We have barely made a dent in CFEngine in this Short Topics Guide. 
Let us end by noting briefly that DevOps and Cloud Computing are
merely rehearsals for what is to come next: molecular computing in
which we synthesize complex clusters of components based on higher
level rule based schemas.

   <p>In this future version of IT, knowledge management will be the key
challenge for understanding how to build systems. We fully expect the
APIs of the future virtualized infrastructure to be promise oriented,
and for CFEngine to remain a viable approach to configuration after
other frameworks have become outmoded.

systems. In Norway more details are codified into federal law. This
means that there is less to talk about in court and legal proceedings
are much more quickly resolved as there is less need to reinvent
interpretations on the fly.</p>

The term classes was originally used but has since been overloaded with connotations from
Object Orientation, etc, making the term confusing.</p>
