<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is knowledge management?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Everyone agrees that Knowledge Management is important, but
few really appreciate what it means to manage knowledge, or how to
begin.  Ironically perhaps, even learning institutions (so-called knowledge
based industries) like schools and universities often do not do a good
job of this.  Having a wealth of knowledge is not the same as knowing
how to foster and protect it.  Most organizations take their
knowledge for granted.

   <p>In the worst case, poorly run organizations end up as collections of
individuals, each of whom possesses knowledge and experience,
but none of whom knows anything about the others' roles.  This scenario presents a
high risk for the continuity of the organization, since taking out
even a single player could cripple a key work process.

   <p>The end result is that many organizations are caught in a poverty trap
of knowledge: they spend their time reacting to emergencies cultivated
by a lack of confidence and certainty, and they are too busy patching over holes that
they never have time to learn enough to escape the pattern.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The Third Wave of configuration management emphasizes the role of knowledge
in coping with the diversity and adaptability that modern organizations crave. 
This document is a beginning towards thinking about IT management in a new way:
as a knowledge resource, or a set of insight-driven intentions that are
maintained by smart machinery. This vision is about rehumanizing System Administration
through a proper division of labour between Man and Machine.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Risk and uncertainty</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Knowledge exists to reduce our uncertainty about the world. We don't
generally learn in order to get smart, or to be experts; rather we
learn by necessity and feel smart when there are no remaining
surprises. Experts are people who can answer questions they already
know the answer to; they are supposedly extra-ordinary. Innovators are
people who can solve new problems &ndash; they are even rarer.

   <p>The main aim of knowledge management is not to make everyone an
expert, but to improve the predictability of workflow processes so
that we can respond to unpredictable changes in the environment with
greater confidence, without losing the feeling of control over
the situations we find ourselves in. 
To do that, we have to make the connections between the appropriate
parts to that we can always obtain the answers.

The road to maturity can be seen as stepping through one or more of
the following progressions:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Data &ndash;&gt; Information &ndash;&gt; Knowledge &ndash;&gt; Wisdom    (DIKW)

</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<img src="dikw.png" alt="DIKW">

   <p>Each of these sequences represents an increasing level of commitment. 
You need to have data to interpret them as information. You need to
have goals or objectives in order to realize them and see results. You
need to have intentions to make promises, and so on.  Ask yourself:
does everyone in your team know your business goals, and how to
translate their efforts into progess?

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The CFEngine Knowledge map</h3>

<p>Maps guide us to where we need to get to from where we are (even when we don't
fully understand where we are). A map places us in the context or a larger
picture and helps us to find our way. 
The Knowledge map is a part of the CFEngine Mission Portal,
which in turn is provided with CFEngine Enterprise Edition. 
Significant instrumentation of the software, user process and policy analysis
are provided in these editions in order to make Knowledge mining as transparent
to the user as possible.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Our first task in Knowledge Management is to create a map of the knowledge
landscape in which we work. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>CFEngine contains a tool <code>cf-know</code> for creating a map called a
Topic Map, that forms to basis of our approach to documentation. 
Further, CFEngine Enterprise Editions, starting with Nova help fill in
the landscape of this map automatically.

   <p>To build a map, you will need data (hence the beginning of the DIKW chain). 
To use a map, you need an objective or an intention, hence the others.

   <p>Ask yourself: what are the places in this map, and what are the paths between them? 
This is a question every organization needs to ask itself.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine does a lot of work for you, but you need to do something to help
yourself too. As with all information, garbage in leads to garbage out. 
Your organization should create documents and references
to capture its internal knowledge. If you are doing this well, it should not be
a major task.

   <p>Knowledge gets out of control when you don't standardize ideas,
concepts and procedures. By standardizing topics and concepts, you
prevent an explosion of redundancy &ndash; only then can you see
the signal in the noise. Standardization minimizes the number of things
you have to deal with. Be careful though, if you go too far, standardization
can become a straightjacket, preventing you from clear and free expression. 
Too much standardization and you will be stuck in a rut.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Dedicate yourself to a culture of simplicity, but not of
over-simplification (which often backfires). Always work to avoid
special cases and exceptions, unless they can be rigorously justified. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>This is a question of economics: is it worth the cost of maintaining a
special case? CFEngine's is designed to make it a lot easier and
cheaper to manage exceptions, so you needn't worry too much. Just
don't go mad.

   <p>Simplification is the hardest thing you will ever do. Anyone can make
something more complicated, but it takes real work to simplify
something<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Einstein's famous quote
captures this: <i>You should always make everything as simple as
possible, but no simpler.</i>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Using the Knowledge Map</h3>

<p>CFEngine's exploration of knowledge management is still in its infancy
&ndash; we are learning constantly about how to use state of the art
technologies and techniques. This is still very much an experimental area
that we continue to improve upon.

   <p>Let's look at the current state of the smart index which we call the
(Copernicus) Knowledge Map. If you go to the Mission Portal Library and
search for a topic, you will land in the Knowledge Map. You will immediately
see a graphical image and number of tabs that contain various different
renditions of the information.

   <p>Presently, these are called:
     <ul>
<li>Map - a visual view of a small neighbourhood of the closest related topics
that places the search topic in the context of closely related items. The search
topic might not be a the centre of this little universe, as other topics can
be more important. The size of the plantary balls is an indication of the topic's
connectedness in the web. 
<li>Leads - an explanation with full text for the nearest neighbours of the search topic. 
<li>References - Actual document links or remarks made about the search topic. 
<li>Same context - Other topics discussed in the same context. 
</ul>

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Knowledge-map-example-1">Knowledge map example 1</a>
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Knowledge-map-example-2">Knowledge map example 2</a>
</ul>

<div class="node">
<a name="Knowledge-map-example-1"></a>
<p><hr>
Next:&nbsp;<a rel="next" accesskey="n" href="#Knowledge-map-example-2">Knowledge map example 2</a>,

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Using-the-Knowledge-Map">Using the Knowledge Map</a>

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Knowledge map example 1</h4>

<p>You enter the knowledge map by searching, or being referred there by a link in
the Mission Portal. Suppose we enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">webserver</span></samp>&rsquo; into the search field. 
CFEngine searches for matching topics in its index, and returns references in
different contexts. The context `any' represents an unspecific reference to the topic
name:

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km1.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>Suppose we click on the first of these in any context; this leads us to a special
landing page about that particular topic which contains the four tabs mentioned above. 
By default we end up in the graphical view. This gives an immediate impression of
roughly where CFEngine considers this topic to lie in the scope of its knowledge. 
However, its value is rather limited. 
<img src="km2.png" alt="DIKW">

   <p>The next step is to walk through the tabs to `drill down' to actual
content. The second tab points us to the `brainstorming' value of the
associative links &ndash; now with explanations in text.  If we select
another tab we arrive at further leads for assisted thinking: these
associative-thinking pointers can guide you to matters that are
related and provide context for the current topic.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km3.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>Leads are helpful if you didn't really know what you were
looking for in the first place &ndash; and you would like some explanation
of what it what you guessed.

   <p>If we select one of these, we go the landing page for that new topic in the advertised
context.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km4.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>Note that several topics might be highlighted
in yellow on a page &ndash; if they have been named, or if they are topics of special importance in
this local cluster (meaning that they are highly referred to).

   <p>In this view we are able to see, at a glance, that this somewhat
Byzantine string is the name of a file, and that is pertains only to
certain operating systems.  Walking through the tabs again, we see
both where we came from and where we can go from here, with
more detailed explanations.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km5.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>So far the map has only shown us topics &ndash; or named subjects
categorized by their context. This gives us a kind of compass for
knowing what the topic is about, but it tells us little about the
subject itself.  The third tab points us to actual expansive
information about the topic, if any is known. This might be information
from the documentation, external links or commentary and remarks made in
policy.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
If there are no references to external information, this tab does not appear. 
Let's choose one of these references; now we are taken to a new topic
altogether, where we see a new view of the system information. 
</td></tr></table>

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km6.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>Because the topic name is categorized in the context of `promises', we
know that (although this is the name of a file and it refers to
RedHat-like operating systems) that this is also the object of a
promise. The references page contains a link that then points us to
actual information about this promise. The textual comment that was attributed
to the promise in the policy itself, and a link to the promise's definiton. 
Clicking on the defintion link takes us the the promise-viewer.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km7.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>The Copernicus Knowledge Map view will take you a while to get used to &ndash; use it
to help you think about matters, and see how they fit together into a systematic
overview of your environment.

<div class="node">

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Using-the-Knowledge-Map">Using the Knowledge Map</a>

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Knowledge map example 2</h4>

<p>Let's look at another example. Suppose we enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vital signs</span></samp>&rsquo; as
the search text, and go to the leads. We find a long list of other
topics. CFEngine says that `vital signs' generalizes, or is an
umbrella concept, for these other concepts.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km8.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>One of these
concepts is a class context that represents an anomaly
detected by CFEngine &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">loadavg_high_dev2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Clicking on this, we see the
significance of this concept quite easily from its relationship
to other concepts:

   <div class="block-image"><img src="km9.png" alt="DIKW"></div>

   <p>The load average being high might be an anomaly, but we also see that it
refers to system performance, as does a whole bunch of other concepts.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The value of the semantic indexing is that it is information a casual user
can actually learn from. By providing context and leads for further thinking,
the Mission Portal becomes an quasi-intelligent assistant for working on
the system.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Types of information</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

There are many kinds of information that contribute to a strategy for
managing knowledge. The ability to learn from past mistakes demands
that we look both forwards and backwards, while realizing that
knowledge grows older and less useful the older it gets. 
For instance, what is known about the past? What
is current? How can we track these things?  Information comes in
logically different categories as well as different types.  Data have
different sources, and are about different epochs.  We need to unify
and integrate these in Knowledge Management.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Conceptual information (Always)</i><dd>
Conceptual information is knowledge of a general nature that defines
basic terms and concepts that describe the operational area of the
organization. e.g. background theory, compliance requirements, frameworks, license
expiry documents. Contracts and agreements.

     <p>This information comes from the wider culture of the enterprise. It is often
treated poorly as our modern culture has an unreasonable suspicion of anything that
seems `academic'.

     <br><dt><i>System observations (Past)</i><dd>
Recording what has actually happened in the organization. This includes
the IT system, but also the business services and workflows, e.g. 
changes, transactions, logs, incidents, events, performance values (Key
Performance Indicators), audits, security scans, etc. This includes
what it traditionally called system monitoring.

     <p>This comes from probing and monitoring human-computer processes.

     <br><dt><i>Enterprise process documentation (Now)</i><dd>
These documents are about business internals, recipes, manuals and
how-tos.  They allow individuals to work autonomously without constant
supervision, because they all have a copy of the script. This
information is about <i>orchestration</i> of parts. In an orchestra each
player can manage to play his or her part with only minimal advice
from a conductor because they each have a copy of their music. Their
music is their process documentation.

     <p>This is closely related to policy and comes from internal management bodies.

     <br><dt><i>Policy (Future)</i><dd>
Here are the promises and intentions of the IT mission.  Documents of
all degrees of technicality form policy. They contain the decisions
you have made for steering the mission under all possible
contingencies.

     <p>Policy is informed by all of the above, and usually changes in
response to recurring `problems' identified in the observations. It
originates from internal management.

   </dl>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Stories and narratives</h3>

<p>In the foregoing section, we saw how leads in the Knowledge Map's
semantic index could help us to see immediate relationships between
system issues. The next question is: what about connections that are less
immediate or obvious?

   <p>In future releases you will be able to ask the agent to brainstorm for you
about topics, telling any stories is knows about topics. A story is a
simply a path through the web of connected information that follows
some kind of connectness. Most interesting stories have a thread of
cause and effect. CFEngine attempts to reason forth narratives that
might be sensible or which might offer some kind of insight. This is
not usually a directly useful revelation, but more often a thought
provoking stimulus for a human to take further.

   <p>Machine intelligence is never a substitute for the real thing, at least
not in our present day technologies, but it can be a useful amplifier of
`leads' to get a smart human thinking about the right things. 
Most CFEngine stories relate to policy, and they are generated automatically
by the knowledge engine, so you will not get any stories until you have
something interesting in your policy.

   <p>Stories will be usable from the command-line, or as a tab within the
Mission Portal. The command line is useful for interactive
thinking:

   <p>A story can be quite simple:
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     atlas$ src/cf-know --tell-me-about ftpusers
     F: "ftpusers" seems to affect "any::/etc/ftpusers" (with 50 % probability)
     
       "ftpusers" (in any),
        see also "/etc/ftpusers" (in any),
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>
   Other stories could be more involved:
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     cf-know --tell-me-about anomalies::cpu0_high_dev2
     
     F: "anomalies::cpu0_high_dev2"
     seems to affect "any::performance" (with 100 % probability)
     
       "cpu0_high_dev2" (in anomalies),
        is a special case of "vital signs" (in any),
        which is a generalization of "users_high_dev1" (in anomalies),
        and this (users_high_dev1) is a special case of "performance" (in any)
     
     (Note also that performance, which was mentioned, is a generalization of
     "anomalies::users_high_dev1")
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">Stories can also be quite spurious, because knowledge itself can be spurious. 
For instance, some guesses might be quite wrong as the system gets the wrong end of the stick,
so to speak, as it uses general patterns and these patterns always have exceptions:
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     atlas$ src/cf-know --tell-me-about operating_systems::suse
     
     F: "operating_systems::suse" seems to affect "any::gnu/linux" (with 100 % probability)
     
       "suse" (in operating_systems),
        is a special case of "linux" (in any),
        and this (linux) seems to refer to "gnu/linux" (in any)
     
     F: "operating_systems::suse" seems to affect "any::unitedlinux" (with 100 % probability)
     
       "suse" (in operating_systems),
        is a special case of "linux" (in any),
        and this (linux) seems to refer to "unitedlinux" (in any)
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>
   Or:
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     atlas$ src/cf-know --tell-me-about functions
     
     F: "any::functions" seems to affect "any::arrays" (with 100 % probability)
     
       "functions" (in any),
        seems to refer to "functions which read" (in any),
        which seems to refer to "functions which read arrays" (in any),
        and this (functions which read arrays) seems to be referred to in "arrays" (in any)
     
     F: "any::functions" seems to affect "any::expression" (with 100 % probability)

        and this (a cfengine class expression) seems to be referred to in "expression"
     (in any)
     ...
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>As you can see, the story generator looks for causative connections between the things
that it knows about. Some topics are from the documentation, and some from your
configuration policy.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating your own map</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
CFEngine provides a lot of knowledge about your system out of the box, that includes a domain
model about the space of IT management, and an automated analysis of the deployed policy. 
Below are some notes about how this is built, and things you can do to improve the information
by adding knowledge that cannot be discovered automatically.
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>You begin by documenting your intentions by creating a CFEngine automation policy, i.e. bundles of promises.

     <li>You add comments, handles, promisees etc to your policy to full explain your intentions.

     <li>You can assign each host in your network to a special class that represents its
physical location, using <code>classes:</code> promises. You should then collect
such classes into a topic context called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">locations::</span></samp>&rsquo; in the <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp> file.

     <li>CFEngine runs <code>cf-promises -r</code> to build a decompsition of your
current policy.

     <li>CFEngine runs <code>cf-know -bf enterprise_build.cf</code> to build the knowledge map.

     <li>You may create enterprise process documents and written policies for your
organization, which you will link into the knowledge map.

     <li>CFEngine Nova creates the Knowledge Map which includes
a conceptual framework for IT management, and which integrates with
the CFEngine software documentation.

     <li>You may now extend the basic knowledge map with more of your
own special documentation by placing references and
additional concepts into the file <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp>, on the policy server.

        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Documenting goals</h3>

<p>Business goals are shown in the Goals app (and service catalogue) in the Mission Portal of CFEngine Enterprise
for each hub. To document the fact that a promise or bundle contributes to a business goal,
you must do two things:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Document the goal (see below under the example <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp> file). e.g. 
<pre class="verbatim">     topics:
     
       goals::
         "goal 1" comment => "Do good things";
         "goal 2" comment => "Be first";
         "goal 3" comment => "Be best";
     
</pre>
<li>Make the goal a promisee of the promise concerned.

     <pre class="verbatim">     methods:
     
        "security"  -> { goal_1, goal_2 }
      
                        comment => "Basic change management",
                      usebundle => change_management;
        "maintenance" 
                        comment => "Perform log rotation",
                      usebundle => garbage_collection;
</pre>

        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Documenting locations</h3>

<p>To document the location of a host, make sure that it is placed inside a class that represents its address:

<pre class="verbatim">classes:

  "london"     or => { "host1", "host2" };
  "alexandria" or => { "host3", "host4", "host5" };

</pre>
Then designate these classes as locations in the knowledge map:
<pre class="verbatim">topics:

 locations::

  "london"     comment => "29 Market Street, London XW4, third on the left";
  "alexandria" comment => "Secret chamber, discovered by Indiana Jones";

</pre>

CFEngine cannot produce everything you need for your library of knowledge. 
There cannot be hard and fast rules about this. Here are some suggestions:

     <ul>
<li>A policy on human roles and responsibilities, to avoid gaps in and unecessary doubling of effort. 
<li>A risk/security policy. 
<li>A standardization and procedure manual. 
<li>Incident logs of matters not detected and repaired by CFEngine. 
<li>Repair logs of matters not  detected and repaired by CFEngine. 
<li>Requests for change (RFC) logs. 
<li>Promises in your organization that are not just for CFEngine to keep, documenting intentions. 
<li>A policy on Knowledge Retention and Business Continuity. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Hint: a simple way to have a log is to use a tickets system like OTRS or a moderated mailing list, and to email
new entries. Something like a Mailman archive allows then tracking and integration.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Knowledge transfer</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Passing on knowledge to others could be considered a `best
practice'.  Alas, this is not as easy as it sounds.  There are plenty
of strategies to achieve knowledge transfer:

     <ul>
<li>Reading
<li>Taking courses
<li>Research
<li>Repetition
<li>Job swapping and promotion
</ul>

<p class="noindent">These are just a few. However, this list is old news, and
these items alone will not lead to knowledge transfer.

   <p>One of the most important <i>barriers</i> to knowledge transfer is that
individuals refuse to learn new things. A lack of dynamism in a
company or organization establishes patterns of habit that are hard to
break. The longer they last, the more likely they are to continue.

   <p>Promise theory makes clear that, even if all staff promise
to write excellent documentation, they do not necessarily promise
to read each others' documents. Transfer requires a commitment both
to send and to receive.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <ul>
<li>The final step to managing knowledge is to foster a culture
of knowledge acquisition, retention and transfer.

     <li>Knowledge transfer requires a commitment by all parties
          <ul>
<li>to learn outside of their box.

          <li>to pass on their expertise to others. 
</ul>
     </ul>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>Communication skills are clearly important, but this is a serious flaw
in the idea. Written communication skills are not as common as we
might think. This means it is hard for the writer, and also for the
reader.

   <p>The solution taken by CFEngine is to reduce the problem of
documentation to one of coding notes and relationships. This requires
only minor writing skills. The technology can then assemble these notes
using intelligent algorithms and present the result in an organized form
with visual aids. You should pay special attention to the syntax items:

<pre class="verbatim"> comment => 
 handle =>
 depends_on =>

 -> { promisees }

</pre>

   <p>You need to foster a culture of using information, in order for it
to become assimilated as knowledge. Unused information will perish.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Knowledge Management Objectives</h3>

<p>As a manifesto for us as developers at CFEngine, as well as for you as
users of the software, and as infrastructure engineers, it is helpful
to make a list of questions that we would like to be able to answer
using enterprise software.  The following list is not to be regarded
as a set of features in CFEngine, but rather as a set of challenges
to be addressed in different ways.

     <ul>
<li>Tell me about the promise(s). 
<li>Tell me what happened to Y. 
<li>Tell me about security. 
<li>Tell me about performance. 
<li>Tell me about compliance. 
<li>Where are the resource problems? 
<li>Where is the greatest/least activity? 
<li>How much spare capacity do I have? 
<li>Where are things changing fastest?

     <li>When do I need to think about X? 
<li>What do I need to know about X? 
<li>What are the most important things that happened?

     <li>Why is this here? 
<li>What can I do about X? 
<li>Who changed X last? 
<li>When can I expect X? 
<li>Where can I find X? 
<li>What things affect X? 
<li>What promises have been made about X? 
<li>What stories lead to conclusion X?
