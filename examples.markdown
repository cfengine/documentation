You can find more examples for CFEngine Code in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/tree/master/examples).

## Running the Example policies

The policy files can be found in `/var/cfengine/share/doc/examples`. You can 
test them locally by copying the respective _example___file.cf_ file into
`/var/cfengine/inputs` and running:

	/var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f example_file.cf

## Integrating the Example into your Main Policy

Make the example policy part of your main policy by
doing the following on your policy server:

1. Copy the file from `/var/cfengine/share/doc/examples` to
    `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`.

2. Delete the `body common control` section in
    `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/example_file.cf`:

``` cf3
    body common control
	{
	    bundlesequence  => { "testbundle" };
	}
```

3. Insert the example's bundle name in the `bundlesequence` section
    of the main policy file `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`:

```cf3
    bundlesequence => {
        ...
        "testbundle",
        ...
    };
```

4. Insert the policy file name in the `inputs` section of the main policy file
    `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`:

```cf3
     inputs => {
         ...
         "example_file.cf",
         ...
    };
```
5. *CONDITIONAL* If the example contains a control body section
   (e.g. "body agent control"):

   You cannot have duplicate control bodies (i.e. two
   agent control bodies, one in the main file and one
   in the example) as CFEngine won't know which it
   should use and they may conflict.

   To resolve this, copy the contents of the
   control body section from the example into the identically named control body
   section in the main policy file `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`
   and then remove the control body from the example.

The example policy will now be executed every five minutes along with the rest
of your main policy.

*NOTE* You may have to fill the example with data before it will work.
For example, the LDAP query in `active_directory.cf` needs a domain name.
In the variable declaration, replace "cftesting" with your domain name:

```cf3
vars:
# NOTE: Edit this to your domain, e.g. "corp"
  "domain_name" string => "cftesting";
```
