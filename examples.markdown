## Tutorial for Running Examples ##


In this tutorial, you will perform the following:

* Create a simple "Hello World!" example policy file
* Make the example a standalone policy
* Make the example an executable script
* Add the example to the main policy file (`promises.cf`)

**Note** if your CFEngine administrator has enabled continuous deployment of the policy from a Version Control System, your changes may be overwritten!

### "Hello World" Policy Example ###

Policies contain **bundles**, which are collections of promises. A **promise** is a declaration of
intent. Bundles allow related promises to be grouped together, as illustrated in the steps that follow.

Following these steps, you will login to your policy server via the SSH protocol, use the vi command line editor to create a policy file named hello_world.cf, and create a bundle that calls a promise to display some text.

1. Log into a running server machine using ssh (PuTTY may be used if using Windows). 
2. Type ```sudo su``` for super user (enter your password if prompted).
3. To get to the __masterfiles__ directory, type ```cd /var/cfengine/masterfiles```.
4. Create the file with the command: ```vi hello_world.cf ```
5. In the vi editor, enter ```i``` for "Insert" and enter the following content (ie. copy and paste from a text editor):

	```cf3
	bundle agent hello_world
	{
	  reports:

		any::
		  
		  "Hello World!";

	}
	```

6. Exit the "Insert" mode by pressing the "esc" button. This will return to the command prompt.
7. Save the changes to the file by typing ```:w``` then "Enter". 
8. Exit vi by typing ```:q``` then "Enter".

In the policy file above, we have defined an **agent bundle** named `hello_world`. Agent
bundles are only evaluated by **cf-agent**, the [agent component][cf-agent] of CFEngine.

This bundle [promises][Promise Types and Attributes] to [report][reports] on any [class of
hosts][Classes and Decisions]. 



### Activate a Bundle Manually ###

Activate the bundle manually by executing the following command at prompt:

```console
% /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock --file ./hello_world.cf --bundlesequence hello_world
```

This command instructs CFEngine to ignore [locks][Controlling Frequency], load
the `hello_world.cf` policy, and activate the `hello_world` bundle. See the output below:

```console
# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock --file ./hello_world.cf --bundlesequence hello_world
2013-08-20T14:03:43-0500   notice: R: Hello World!
```

As you get familiar with CFEngine, you'll probably start shortening this command to this equivalent:

```console
/var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -Kf ./hello_world.cf -b hello_world
```


Note the full path to the binary in the above command. CFEngine stores its binaries in /var/cfengine/bin
on Linux and Unix systems. Your path might vary depending on your platform and the packages your are using. 
CFEngine uses /var because it is one of the Unix file systems that resides locally. 
Thus, CFEngine can function even if everything else fails 
(your other file systems, your network, and even system binaries) and possibly repair problems. 



### Make the Example Stand Alone ###

Instead of specifying the bundle sequence on the command line (as it was above), a [body common
control][Components and Common Control#Common Control] section can be added to
the policy file. The **body common control** refers to those promises that are hard-coded into
all CFEngine components and therefore affect the behavior of all components. Note that only
 one `body common control` is allowed per agent activation.

Go back into vi by typing "vi" at the prompt. Then type ```i``` to insert
 __body common control__ to `hello_world.cf`. Place it above __bundle agent hello_world__, as 
shown in the following example:

```cf3
body common control
{
  bundlesequence => { "hello_world" };
}

bundle agent hello_world
{
  reports:

    any::
      
      "Hello World!";

}
```

Now press "esc" to exit the "Insert" mode, then type ```:w``` to save the file changes and "Enter".
Exit vi by typing ```:q``` then "Enter." This will return to the prompt.

Execute the following command:  
```
/var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock --file ./hello_world.cf
```

The output is shown below:

```
# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock --file ./hello_world.cf
2013-08-20T14:25:36-0500   notice: R: Hello World!
```

Note: It may be necessary to add a reference to the standard library within the body common control section, and remove the bundlesequence line. Example:

```cf3
body common control {

    inputs => {
       "libraries/cfengine_stdlib.cf",
    };
}
```

### Make the Example an Executable Script ###

Add the ```#!``` marker ("shebang") to `hello_world.cf` in order to invoke CFEngine policy as an executable script:
Again type "vi" then "Enter" then ```i``` to insert the following:

```
#!/var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock
```

Add it before __body common control__, as shown below:

```cf3
#!/var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --no-lock
body common control
{
  bundlesequence => { "hello_world" };
}

bundle agent hello_world
{
  reports:

    any::
      
      "Hello World!";

}
```

Now exit "Insert" mode by pressing "esc". Save file changes by typing ```:w``` then "Enter" 
then exit vi by typing ```:q``` then "Enter". This will return to the prompt.

Make the policy file executable, and then run it, by typing the following two commands:

```
chmod +x ./hello_world.cf 
```

Followed by:

```
./hello_world.cf
```

See the output below:

```
# chmod +x ./hello_world.cf
# ./hello_world.cf
2013-08-20T14:39:34-0500   notice: R: Hello World!
```


### Integrating the Example into your Main Policy ###

Make the example policy part of your main policy by
doing the following on your policy server:

1. Ensure the example is located in `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`.

2. If the example contains a `body common control` section, delete it. That 
section will look something like this:

	```cf3  
		  body common control
		  {
			bundlesequence  => { "hello_world" };
		  }
	```
		
You cannot have duplicate control bodies (i.e. two
agent control bodies, one in the main file and one
in the example) as CFEngine won't know which it
should use and they may conflict.

To resolve this, copy the contents of the control body section from the
example into the identically named control body section in the main policy
file `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`and then remove the control body
from the example.		

3. Insert the example's bundle name in the `bundlesequence` section
    of the main policy file `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`:

	```cf3  
		  bundlesequence => {
			  ...
			  "hello_world",
			  ...
		  };
	```

4. Insert the policy file name in the [`inputs`][Components and Common Control#inputs] section of the main policy file
    `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf`:

	```cf3  
	inputs => {
	    ...
		"hello_world.cf",
        ...
	};
	```

5. You must also remove any inputs section from the example that 
   includes the external library:

	```cf3  
    inputs => {
	    "libraries/cfengine_stdlib.cf"
    };
	```

    This is necessary, since `cfengine_stdlib.cf` is already included
    in the inputs section of the master policy.

6. The example policy will now be executed every five minutes along with the rest
of your main policy.

**Notes:** You may have to fill the example with data before it will work.
For example, the LDAP query in `active_directory.cf` needs a domain name.
In the variable declaration, replace "cftesting" with your domain name:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(integrating_the_example_into_your_main_policy.cf, .* )%]
