CFEngine is a suite of programs for integrated autonomic management
of either individual or networked computers. It has existed as as
software suite since 1993 and this version published under the GNU
Public License (GPL v3) and a Commercial Open Source License
(COSL). CFEngine is Copyright by **CFEngine AS**, a company founded
by CFEngine author Mark Burgess.

This document describes major version 3 of CFEngine, which is a
significant departure from earlier versions, and represents the
newest and most carefully researched technology available for
configuration management. It is both simpler and more powerful.
CFEngine 3 exists as both free open source and commercial
enterprise versions:

-   **Community Edition** - a free and gratis core of the software
    (available now).
-   **Enterprise** - a commercial enhanced version for basic
    enterprise needs (available now; previously known as Nova).

This document is valid for **all versions** of CFEngine. Whenever a
feature is only available in a specific version, that fact will be
noted in the documentation for that feature (if there is no note,
then that feature is available in all versions).

CFEngine 3 has been changed to be both a more powerful tool and a
much simpler tool. CFEngine 3's language interface is not backwards
compatible with the CFEngine 2 configuration language, but it
interoperates with CFEngine 2 so that it is "run-time compatible".
This means that you can change over to version 3 slowly, with low
risk and at your own speed.

With CFEngine 3 you can install, configure and maintain computers
using powerful hands-free tools. You can also integrate knowledge
management and diagnosis into the processes.

CFEngine differs from most management systems in being

-   Open software (GPL or COSL).
-   Lightweight and generic.
-   Non-reliant on a working network to function correctly.
-   Capable of making each and every host autonomous
