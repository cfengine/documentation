CFEngine 3 represents the newest and most carefully researched
technology available for configuration management. It is both simpler
and more powerful than previous versions. [Learn more about CFEngine.](https://cfengine.com/what-is-cfengine)

CFEngine 3 exists in [two editions](https://cfengine.com/cfengine-comparison):

- **[Enterprise](https://cfengine.com/enterprise)** for organizations that 
  demand predictability, control, and orchestration of complex, heterogenous, 
  and distributed infrastructures.
- **[Community Edition](https://cfengine.com/community)** - the core
  of CFEngine for configuration management of servers running Unix-like
  operating systems.

This documentation is valid for **all versions** of CFEngine except where noted.

#### History of CFEngine

CFEngine is a suite of programs for integrated autonomic management
of either individual or networked computers. It has existed as a
software suite since 1993.

With CFEngine 3, CFEngine has been changed to be both a more powerful
tool and a much simpler tool. CFEngine 3's language interface is not
backwards compatible with the CFEngine 2 configuration language, but it
interoperates with CFEngine 2 so that it is "run-time compatible".
This means that you can change over to version 3 slowly, with low
risk and at your own speed.
