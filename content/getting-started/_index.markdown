CFEngine allows you to configure and automate all your IT infrastructure, including, servers, desktops and IoT devices.
It enables efficient changes across large fleets of devices and automatic self-healing / drift correction according to the desired state.
With it's flexible and performant reporting system, you can have up to date inventory and compliance reports even with hundreds of thousands of endpoints under management.

[CFEngine Build](https://build.cfengine.com) is the website where the CFEngine users can share and find modules from the rest of the community.
These modules allow you to add functionality and achieve useful tasks in CFEngine without writing any code.

In this tutorial series we will learn CFEngine the easy way, first focusing on installation, out of the box functionality, ready to use modules, and the web user interface (Mission Portal).
Afterwards, we will continue to more advanced topics, such as policy writing and module development.
