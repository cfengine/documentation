## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a term coined by Patrick Debois in 2009, from an amalgamation of
Development and Operations. It expresses a change in the way companies are
thinking about IT - a change from segregated IT infrastructure to highly
integrated platforms. Leading the way is a group of highly innovative Web-based
companies whose businesses depend on very specific arrangements of
infrastructure. It is about giving software developers more influence over the
IT infrastructure their applications run on, and allowing change at the same
speed as agile development teams.

## Why is DevOps happening now?

The proliferation of Free and Open Source software has put powerful software
components in the hands of a broader range of developers than ever before - and
businesses everywhere are exploiting this software by adapting it and combining
it is a wealth of mutations. This blurs the line between what used to be
development and what used to be the system administrator's domain (operations).
We have entered an age analogous to that of hobby electronics for IT systems,
where we can order off-the-shelf components and build cool new applications from
them anywhere.

After 20 years of scepticism, business and Free Open Source software have made
friends and are working together creatively for the benefit of willing
consumers. With this basic premise of agility, companies working in this area
naturally embrace a rapid innovation cycle, meaning a fast release cycle too.
Traditional IT management methods can be perceived as too slow in such an
environment. An important part of DevOps is that it naturally encompasses the
idea of business integration - or IT for a purpose.

## Should Web and IT management be closely related?

Web frameworks have seen the rise of languages like PHP, Java, Python and Ruby,
all of which offer frameworks for fast deployment. Languages that work well for
application development are not well suited to managing infrastructure however:
they focus too much on low level details that one would like to suppress. The
fact that programmers already know the languages does not change this.

An important principle for robustness and stability of systems is weak coupling
between components. This brings flexibility rather than brittle fragility.
Giving programmers direct control over infrastructure from their applications
risks insufficient separation in which infrastructure management becomes a
second-class citizen run by amateurs who just want to get code out there and
don't properly understand the implications. The System Administrator role exists
for a reason.

Should we use the web and HTTP for everything just because we know it? We
suggest not. HTTP is an inefficient protocol for operations. It was designed for
1:1 communication with centralized certificate verification, not for
decentralized 1000000:1 communication, as testified by the extensive need for
load balancers in web farms.

At CFEngine, we believe in lightweight management - made as simple as possible,
but no simpler.

## How do we make controlled change faster?

It is important to be able to make changes quickly. Automation can implement
change quickly if humans can get their acts together. Human IT processes and
best practices (e.g. ITIL, COBIT, etc) tend to over bureaucratize change,
leading to unnecessary overhead which frustrates agile companies.

To be confident and efficient (_less haste more speed_), there needs to be a
model for the system that everyone agrees on. Models compress information and
cache understanding, meaning we have less to talk about1. Finally, models allow
us to make predictions, so they aid understanding and help us to avoid mistake.

CFEngine's promise model offers a flexible approach to weakly-coupled autonomous
resource configuration. It simultaneously allows efficient, convergent, and
repeatable implementation, and a simple definition of compliance with
requirements2. All web-based companies using credit cards will know about the
need for PCI-DSS compliance, for instance. And US-traded companies will know
about Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX).

## What role does CFEngine play in DevOps?

The challenges for IT management today are about increasing complexity (driven
by the circuitry of online applications) and increasing scale.

CFEngine is not a programming language, but a documentation language for system
state that has the pleasant side effect of enforcing that state on a continuous
basis. It gets away from the idea of _build automation_ to complete lifecycle
management. It's continuity is a natural partner for a rapid development
environment, as mistakes can be quickly fixed on the fly with minimal impact on
the system.

CFEngine's wins are that it is massively scalable, very low impact and rich in
functionality. It will not break at a few hundred machines or choke off network
communications with overhead. It will fix practically any well-defined problem
within 5 minutes, bringing dependability and agility.

Knowledge, business integration - metrics

The advantage CFEngine brings is that users can have clear expectations about
their systems at all times. Today's programmers are more sophisticated than
script monkeys.

## Getting used to declarative expression

CFEngine uses a pragmatic mixture of the declarative (functional) and imperative
to represent configurations. Programmers are taught mainly imperative
programming today, so a declarative approach could seem like a barrier to
adoption. The principles are very simple however, and easy for developers to
grasp.

In spite of the focus on readability for documenting intent, all the familiar
structures of imperative programming are, in fact, available in CFEngine, just
optimized for clarity.

The main goals of CFEngine are convergence to a desired state, repeatability and
clear intentions.

### Expressing actions or tasks in CFEngine

Most of the actionable items have builtin operational support, which is designed
to be convergent and safely repeatable. To keep declarations clear, CFEngine
organizes similar operations into chapters in a simple separation of concerns.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:
     "affected object" ...details....

  processes:
     "affected object" ...details....

}
```

In general, many such promises and types are collected into bundles, so that the
form is

```cf3
bundle agent SomeUserDefinedName
{
  type_of_promise:

    "affected object/promiser"

     body of the promise/details
 ...
}
```

### Expressing conditionals in CFEngine

CFEngine uses the idea of contexts (also called classes or class-contexts3) to
address declarations to certain environments. The contexts or classes are
written as a prefix, a bit like a target in a Makefile. They represent known
properties of the environment.

```cf3
bundle agent SomeUserDefinedName
{

  type_of_promise:

    property::

      make one promise...

    !property::

      make a different promise...
}
```

This is the mechanism by which all decisions are made in CFEngine. Class
contexts are evaluated bycf-agentand are cached so that they can be used at any
time.

How do we know if the property has been evaluated or not? CFEngine evaluates
certain hard-classes by default. In addition, you can probe as many more as you
like, as separate promises.

```cf3
bundle agent SomeUserDefinedName
{
 classes:

   "cached_result" expression => fileexists("/some/file");
   "bigger"        and => { isgreaterthan("1","0"), "cached_result" };

}
```

This is different from a programming language where you generally make these
tests in-line when you need them. In CFEngine the chance that you need the same
test multiple times is greater, so the determination is separated entirely from
the usage.

To go from if-then-else thinking to using classes, you just need to thihnk about
classes as booleans:

```cf3
bundle agent Name
{
  classes:

     "cached_result" expression => fileexists("/some/file");
     "bigger"        and => { isgreaterthan("1","0"), "cached_result" };

  reports:

    bigger::
      "Bigger is true....";

    cached_result&!bigger::
      "Mathematics seems to be awry...";

    # may also be written cached_result.!bigger::
}
```

These results can then be extended and reused efficiently. The class definitions
can be hidden away and suitably meaningful class names replace a lot of
redundant syntax.

All the information about class contexts is evaluated at the end-host, in a
decentralized manner avoiding clogging of network communications that befuddles
many centralized approaches. This keeps CFEngine execution very fast and with a
low overhead.

### Expressing loops in CFEngine

Lists and loops go hand in hand, and they are a very effective way of reducing syntax and simplifying the expression of intent.
Saying _do this to all the following_ is generally easier to comprehend than _do this to the first, do this to the next,..._ and so on, because our brains are wired to see patterns.

Thus, loops are as useful for configuration as for programming. We only want to
simplify the syntax once again to hide redundant words like `foreach`. To do
this, CFEngine makes loops implicit. If you use a scalar variable reference
`$(mylist)` to a list variable `@(mylist)`, CFEngine assumes you want to iterate
over each case.

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  vars:
     "my_list" slist => { "one", "two", "three" };

  files:
     "/tmp/file_$(my_list)"
               create => "true";
}
```

The above evaluates to three promises:

```cf3
bundle agent example
{
  files:

     "/tmp/file_one"
               create => "true";

     "/tmp/file_two"
               create => "true";

     "/tmp/file_three"
               create => "true";
 }
```

Similarly the following

```cf3
bundle agent x
{
  vars:
     "hi"   string => "Hello";
     "list1" slist => { "a", "b", "c" };
     "list2" slist => { "1", "2", "3", "4" };
     "list3" slist => { "x", "y", "z" };

  reports:
     !silly_non_existent_context::
       "$(hi) $(list1) $(list2) $(list3)";
}
```

Results in:

```
R: Hello a 1 x
R: Hello b 1 x
R: Hello c 1 x
R: Hello a 2 x
R: Hello b 2 x
R: Hello c 2 x
R: Hello a 3 x
R: Hello b 3 x
R: Hello c 3 x
R: Hello a 4 x
R: Hello b 4 x
R: Hello c 4 x
R: Hello a 1 y
R: Hello b 1 y
R: Hello c 1 y
R: Hello a 2 y
R: Hello b 2 y
R: Hello c 2 y
R: Hello a 3 y
R: Hello b 3 y
R: Hello c 3 y
R: Hello a 4 y
R: Hello b 4 y
R: Hello c 4 y
R: Hello a 1 z
R: Hello b 1 z
R: Hello c 1 z
R: Hello a 2 z
R: Hello b 2 z
R: Hello c 2 z
R: Hello a 3 z
R: Hello b 3 z
R: Hello c 3 z
R: Hello a 4 z
R: Hello b 4 z
R: Hello c 4 z
```

### Expressing subroutines in CFEngine

Subroutines are used for both expressing and reusing parameterizable chunks of
code, and for naming chunks for better management of intention. In CFEngine you
define these asmethods. A method is simply a bundle of promises, possibly with
parameters. To call a method, you make a method-use-bundle promise. In this
example, we call a bundle calledsubtestwhich accepts a parameter from its
calling bundle.

```cf3
body common control
{
# Master execution list
bundlesequence  => { "testbundle"  };
}

###########################################

bundle agent testbundle
{
vars:
 "userlist" slist => { "one", "two", "three" };

methods:
 "any" usebundle => subtest("$(userlist)");
}

###########################################

bundle agent subtest(user)
{
commands:
  "/bin/echo Fix $(user)";
}
```

The use of methods brings multi-dimensional patterns to convergent configuration
management.

##Using CFEngine to integrate software components

Integration of software components may be addressed with a variety of approaches
and techniques:

- Standard template methods from the COPBL community library (_out of the box_
  solutions).

- Customized, personalized configurations.

- Package management for software dependencies.

- File management - copying, editing, permissions, etc.

- Process management - starting, stopping, restarting.

- Security.

- Monitoring performance and change.

Needless to say, all of these are easily achievable with 5 minute repair
accuracy using our CFEngine framework.

# Cloud computing is a rehearsal

We have barely made a dent in CFEngine in this Short Topics Guide. Let us end by
noting briefly that DevOps and Cloud Computing are merely rehearsals for what is
to come next: molecular computing in which we synthesize complex clusters of
components based on higher level rule based schemas.

In this future version of IT, knowledge management will be the key challenge for
understanding how to build systems. We fully expect the APIs of the future
virtualized infrastructure to be promise oriented, and for CFEngine to remain a
viable approach to configuration after other frameworks have become outmoded.

details are codified into federal law. This means that there is less to talk
about in court and legal proceedings are much more quickly resolved as there is
less need to reinvent interpretations on the fly.

connotations from Object Orientation, etc, making the term confusing.
