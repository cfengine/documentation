Using an editor that provides syntax highlighting and other features can significantly enhance prodcutivity and quality of life.

## Emacs

For Emacs users, editing CFEngine policies is easy with the built-in CFEngine 3 mode in the [cfengine.el library](https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/master/contrib/cfengine.el). For an overview of the capabilities, see the [webinar by Ted Zlatanov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PPVhwSKNdE) and Appendix A of Diego Zamboni's [Learning CFEngine](https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/) book.

## Spacemacs

Spacemacs has a [CFEngine layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Btools/cfengine/README.org) that configures many of the features shown in the Emacs webinar above out of the box as well as integration for executing `cfengine3` `src` blocks in `org-mode`. It's a great way for `vi/vim` lovers to leverage the power of Emacs.

## Vi/Vim

Vi/Vim users can edit CFEngine policies with Neil Watson's CFEngine 3 scripts, available as GPL-software [on GitHub](https://github.com/neilhwatson/vim_cf3). Neil's vi mode is also described in Appendix B of Diego Zamboni's "Learning CFEngine" book.

## Atom / Pulsar

Using Githubs hackable editor?
You can get syntax highlighting with the [language-cfengine3](https://github.com/olehermanse/language-cfengine3) package.
This extension is available in both [Atom (discontinued)](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/sunsetting-atom/) and [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/), a fork of Atom.
