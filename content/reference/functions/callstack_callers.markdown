{{< CFEngine_function_prototype() >}}

**Description:** Return the call stack for the current promise.

{{< CFEngine_function_attributes() >}}

This is a call stack inspection function and the specific content may be tied
to a specific CFEngine version. Using it requires writing code that takes the
specific CFEngine version into account.

The returned data container is a list of key-value maps.

The maps all have a `type` key and a `frame` key with a counter. For different
frames along the stack frame path, the maps have additional keys:

- whenever possible,
- bodies: under key `body` the entry has a full dump of the body policy as JSON, same as what `cf-promises -p json` would produce, using the internal C function `BodyToJson()`. This may include the `line` and `sourcePath` to locate the exact code line.
- bundles: under key `bundle` the entry has a full dump of the bundle policy as JSON, same as what `cf-promises -p json` would produce, using the internal C function `BundleToJson()`. This may include the `line` and `sourcePath` to locate the exact code line.
- promise iteration: the `iteration_index` is recorded
- promises: the `promise_type`, `promiser`, `promise_classes`, and `promise_comment` are recorded
- promise sections (types): the `promise_type` is recorded

**Example:**

```cf3 {skip TODO}
vars:
  "stack" data => callstack_callers();
```

Output:

```
[ ... call stack information ... ,
  {
    "depth": 2,
    "frame": 9,
    "promise_classes": "any",
    "promise_comment": "",
    "promise_type": "methods",
    "promiser": "",
    "type": "promise"
  }, ... more call stack information ... ]
```

**History:** Introduced in CFEngine 3.9
